## What is this?

A mobile-friendly, fast reader for [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.com/). I got tired of substack crashing on my laptop so I put all his posts on this site.

## How does this work?

This is based on [timf34/Substack2Markdown](https://github.com/timf34/Substack2Markdown) which I modified to work with Github Pages ([ACXReader/Substack2Jekyll](https://github.com/ACXReader/Substack2Jekyll)). I also set up a Github Actions workflow to check for new ACX posts every 10 minutes and commit them to this repo.

This website uses the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) Jekyll theme.
