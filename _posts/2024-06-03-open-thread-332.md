This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Thanks to everyone who talked to me at the Less Online conference. Thanks especially to the person who gave me a working GPS-based version of the automated land acknowledger from [Bay Area House Party](/p/bride-of-bay-area-house-party), it’s one of the most interesting gifts I’ve ever received and I’m looking forward to bringing it to some other city to test its functionality:

**2:** Comment of the week: [why does Britain let submarine commanders launch nukes on their own, when Russia and America have the opposite policy?](/p/links-for-may-2024/comment/57578309) Also related to the links post: someone on Facebook says that Cryonics Institute has not confirmed that Paris Hilton is signed up, and this might be a false story.

**3:** Lyman Stone [has responded to](https://medium.com/@lymanstone/effective-altruism-is-still-bad-7c2a6c947122) my response to him. I think it just doubles down on the same bad points he made the first time, so I might not get around to writing a full response. I’ll just say that first, I think he would benefit from reading about the difference between rule utilitarianism, two-level utilitarianism, and virtue ethics - Mill, Hare, or Parfit would be good sources, or even just some of the blog posts I linked. Second, he seems confused that I’ve blocked him on Twitter. I want to stress that I never block people just because I disagree with them; the only reason I block people is because of a history of doxxing, which Stone has, and which enrages me for deep personal reasons. I think in an ideal world this would merit a permaban from Twitter, but all I can do personally is block him from reading my stuff.

**4:** Berkeley meetup this Wednesday at 6:00 at 2740 Telegraph. I’ll be there. I’ll probably post a reminder with slightly more information tomorrow or Tuesday.
