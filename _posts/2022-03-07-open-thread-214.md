This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

 **1:** Crypto exchange FTX announces the launch of the Future Fund ([blog announcement](https://ftxfuturefund.org/announcing-the-future-fund/), [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ftxfuturefund/status/1498350483206860801?s=20&t=KT_U0F4uwf5s2zD3eM2ogQ)), a philanthropic organization run by various great people who I trust. They hope to spend $100 million - $1 billion per year on cause areas that improve the long-term future, including AI alignment, biosecurity, climate, nuclear war, education, prediction markets, and [many more](https://ftxfuturefund.org/projects/). What this means for you:

  * If you have a project that needs funding in one of those areas, [apply to them](https://ftxfuturefund.org/apply/).

  * They’re experimenting with “regranting”, ie if you’re a knowledgeable person who expects to be able to find and assess projects that they would miss, you can apply for a discretionary budget (“in the $250K - few million range”) and they’ll let you give it out. See their [regranting page](https://ftxfuturefund.org/announcing-our-regranting-program/) for more.

  * If you have an idea for a project they should try to figure out a way to create and fund, enter their [Project Ideas Competition](https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-project-ideas-competition/), and win $5000 if it’s good enough to add to their list of such projects. Warning: this contest closes tomorrow (Monday)!




 **2:** Related: the Open Philanthropy Project’s long-termist effective altruist movement-building team is hiring. They work to direct donations, spread the word about effective altruism, and make the movement more capable. Pay is low six-figures, living in SF is recommended but not absolutely required. [See here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uM6KFEpGuFivsJJHM/open-phil-s-longtermist-ea-movement-building-team-is-hiring) for more info.

 **3:** On my previous post, Ukraine Warcasting, I asked people for the names of anyone who had successfully predicted both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the strong Ukrainian resistance, and said I’d signal-boost them if they existed. Someone [brought up](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/t443t5/ukraine_warcasting/hywjzpb/) a Hungarian YouTuber named Adam Something, who I am [dutifully signal-boosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OO3RiNMDB8&feature=youtu.be). Another commenter pointed out that Anatoly Karlin [was wrong before he was right](https://twitter.com/akarlin0/status/1468659468544139271). Many such cases!
