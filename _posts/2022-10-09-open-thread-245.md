This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** Neil Thanedar of LabDoor doesn’t agree with the way I characterized his company on [my post on supplements](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/how-trustworthy-are-supplements) and has [a response up here](https://twitter.com/NeilThanedar/status/1577675402784407553). I have edited the post slightly to be more noncommittal until I can explain my reasoning - which I hope to do on a Highlights From The Comments post eventually.

**2:** Edwin Chen has [surveyed some people ](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/dall-e-vs-imagen-and-evaluating-astral-codex-tens-3000-ai-bet)on whether the Imagen images on my AI art post match the prompts, and most people believe that 1-2 do, rather than the 3 I claimed. Given that, I am retracting my claim to have won the bet - which I guess is still on - and adding this to [my Mistakes page](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/mistakes). Sorry to Vitor and others. I will revisit this sometime in or before 2025, I guess!

**3:** Alexandros Marinos [continues ](https://doyourownresearch.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-less-than-you-needed)his critique of [my ivermectin post](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted), and his broader ivermectin advocacy. I can’t remember if I’ve said this before, but I commit to writing a summary and response within four months of him being done, which as far as I can tell is not yet (yes, four months is a long time, but it’s a long series and I’m really busy this winter). His most recent post argues that the big COVID drug trials (TOGETHER, ACTIV-6, COVID-OUT) haven’t made their data public, and offers to donate $25,000 to a charity of my choice if I can get them to do so. I have no idea how to do this, but I agree that they should; if anyone from these trials wants to get in touch with me and talk about it and I would be interested in hearing what’s going on.

**4:** Substack asks me to let you all know that they now have [an app](https://substack.com/app), available on iOS and Android.

**5:** I got to talk to Daniel Ingram ([Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha](https://www.integrateddaniel.info/book), etc) last week. He mentions that his [Emergent Phenomenology Research Consortium](https://theeprc.org/) \- intended to help investigate phenomena usually considered “spiritual”/”psychedelic”/”mystical” like meditation and enlightenment, and to help health care workers better understand medical/psychiatric issues related to them - is going well but needs funding. [Go here](https://theeprc.org/donations-friends/) to learn more about how to help. They are also interested in connecting with meditators, researchers, and medical practitioners interested in their mission - see [here](https://theeprc.org/#contact) for more.

**6:** Thanks to everyone who showed up to the LA meetup yesterday. [San Diego meetup](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/la-and-san-diego-meetups-this-weekend) still scheduled for today, hope to see you there! Sorry that I am probably very rude and keep breaking off conversations halfway through because I have more people I need to talk to.

**7:** Misha Saul, who won the Readers’ Choice in last year’s Book Review Contest for his _Disunited Nations_ and _Dawn Of Eurasia_ review, has a Substack, [Kvetch](https://kvetch.substack.com/), with posts like [The Heroes We’re Allowed](https://kvetch.substack.com/p/the-heroes-were-allowed), [Why Practice Judaism](https://kvetch.substack.com/p/why-practice-judaism), and [The Enigma Of Clarence Thomas](https://kvetch.substack.com/p/the-enigma-of-clarence-thomas).
