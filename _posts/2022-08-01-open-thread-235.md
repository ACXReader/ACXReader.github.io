This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** We’ve made it through the original twelve Book Review finalists. I’m busy the next few weeks and want to keep the free Friday posts, so I’m adding four more: _Exhaustion: A History,_ _God Emperor of Dune, 1587,_ and _Kora In Hell_. I chose these through a combination of reader preference, my preference, and wanting to showcase some unusual genres of review. I realize this is annoying to other finalists who will have to wait longer for a smaller chance at a prize, so I’ll double the amount of all monetary prizes as compensation.

**2:** The statistics team behind [TuringElect](https://withdata.io/election/), “a new project to build Bayesian forecasts for the 2022 midterms”, is looking for a media partner. If you’re in media and you want an electoral model kind of like what 538 is doing, get in touch with them. They’ve also got interesting stuff like [this analysis of exactly when the US polarized](https://withdata.io/election/preview/). You can also email cdp49@cam.ac.uk if you’re interested in sponsoring or volunteering for related open source work.

**3:** Reminder: if someone here asks a question, it’s a bannable offense to comment something like “the answer to this is obvious” or “I can’t believe anyone could not know the answer” without providing the answer.
