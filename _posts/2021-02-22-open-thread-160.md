This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about whatever you want. Also:

 **1:** In my post on the precision of sensory evidence, I cited a finding that depressed people had impaired color vision, ie literally saw the world in shades of gray. An alert reader sends me [a paper that discredits ](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1778/v1)one of the main results in that field. I’m not going to completely retract the claim, because there are [other non-discredited papers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322310001290) showing the same thing, and the discredited one just showed people a sad movie rather than using real depressed people. But I appreciate the reminder that this is still controversial and needs further research.

 **2:** ACX’s unofficial fan bulletin board, Data Secrets Lox, announced the results of their recent Best Post competition. First place was Evan on [Tax prep volunteering as a window into society](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2346.msg66205.html#msg66205). Second was [Bean on whaling and fishing vessels](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2409.msg68515.html#msg68515). Third was [David W on chemical plant design](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2496.msg71580.html#msg71580). Check them out!

3: Somebody sent me some Javascript that could fix problems with the comments, and then I lost it. If that’s you, you can send it again and I’ll mention it on the next Open Thread, sorry.
