Ramparen [writes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3201665):

> No one really does it because of climate change imo, that is just a neat excuse to avoid the responsibility and limitations that being a parent brings into your life

Of course, this was immediately followed by some people ([1, ](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3201911)[2](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3213235)) saying _they_ were seriously considering not having kids because of climate change, and this article had caused them to rethink their stance (you can find more further down).

I don‚Äôt want to pick on Ramperen in particular because a lot of people made this point. But I do want to pick on _someone_ , so here goes.

We talk about the Principle of Charity here a lot, and most of you are willing to grant it to right-wingers. If this was the post about how some people [really do oppose abortion for moral reasons](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/30/fetal-attraction-abortion-and-the-principle-of-charity/), and it‚Äôs not just sexism - or how some people [really do oppose immigration for cultural reasons](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/), and it‚Äôs not just racism - or anything along these lines, everyone would be on board. But I think this ethos of acknowledging that people can be honest and have principles, and not immediately jump to ‚Äúthey‚Äôre making it up‚Äù cuts both ways. Some people are actually really concerned about global warming.

Some people in the comments linked to a University of Bath survey in which [56% of young people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-58549373) said they thought ‚Äúhumanity is doomed‚Äù because of climate change. I haven‚Äôt looked at the survey closely to see if the methodology was good or if this is a fair summary, and probably some of this is just mood affiliation - ‚Äú‚Äòyes‚Äô is the side you‚Äôre supposed to take if you‚Äôre progressive, right?‚Äù But I think a lot of young people actually think the world is doomed. If you think the world is doomed - and that its death throes will be pretty horrible - that actually does sound like a good reason not to have children, doesn‚Äôt it?

And - a lot of people are vegetarian for ethical reasons, right? That suggests that people sometimes make really major and inconvenient life changes because of their principles. Why is it hard to believe that the decision to have kids could be one of them?

We know that [knowing about biases can hurt people](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AdYdLP2sRqPMoe8fb/knowing-about-biases-can-hurt-people). All this cynical stuff about bias and signaling and mood affiliation is good to know, but at some point you have to drop it and admit that occasionally some people do things for the reasons they say that they‚Äôre doing them, or else it‚Äôs impossible to have a conversation or think in a straight line. I‚Äôm sure that for a lot of people the climate is just one of many reasons why they‚Äôre turned off of having children, but I take them seriously when they say it is one of the reasons.

I will grudgingly tolerate Luis Pedro‚Äôs take on this for at least bringing up an interesting question:

[![Twitter avatar for @luispedrocoelho](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/luispedrocoelho.jpg)luispedro.substack.comüåª @luispedrocoelhoPrior to legal of gay marriage, several people told me they were not getting married because marriage was a homophobic institution I don't remember a single instance of a straight couple saying "we are finally marrying" once gay marriage was legal ](https://twitter.com/luispedrocoelho/status/1447900942171615232)[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_600,h_314,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb86922b-b202-4ae5-b6f2-6a89ff98ba66_768x432.jpeg)astralcodexten.substack.comPlease Don‚Äôt Give Up On Having Kids Because Of Climate ChangeIt will probably make things worse, and there are better ways to contribute](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids)[12:24 PM ‚àô Oct 12, 2021](https://twitter.com/luispedrocoelho/status/1447900942171615232)

I knew a few people in this situation who I was pretty sure actually really wanted to marry, but I don‚Äôt know if I ever followed up on them. Does anyone else have an experience with a couple like that? If so, what happened?

moonshadow [adds](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3205539):

> Indeed, looking at other replies here - people are "too lazy" to have kids, "too immature" to have kids, have "excuses" not to have kids... the reality is that not having kids is a decision one is continuously called to justify and defend against attack in ways other life choices are not.

I agree - I don‚Äôt see this a lot in my everyday life, so it was pretty disappointing to see how many commenters here want to challenge other people‚Äôs life choices not to become parents. I‚Äôm always surprised how willing people are to tear up the liberal contract of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt question your (non-externality-having) life choices, you don‚Äôt question mine‚Äù, _especially_ when they‚Äôre not guaranteed to be on the winning side, and would completely freak out if the other side tried to create stigma against _them_.

Plus, other people not having children just means more places at top colleges available for _your_ kids!

Am _I_ being one of those people? Moonshadow fairly [asks me](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3201740), in the context of why I wrote this post:

> Why do you think it is important to convince people who are planning not to have kids to have kids?

Here I have a simple answer, which is that a lot of people really want kids, and having kids would make them happy, and if some of those people weren‚Äôt having kids because of climate change, that would make their lives worse. I think telling them that their reason for making their life worse is wrong is an easy way to give them a happier life.

Crotchety Crank [writes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3202399):

> Thanks for this article, Scott - I have a few friends who want kids themselves, but who have found themselves being talked down to by joyless scolds who will denounce them (to their faces, in public) for wanting to have kids, and insisting they would be deeply wrong to do so, for climate-related reasons. (I hope people like this are not also problems in other people's circles.

I think a lot of people who don‚Äôt want kids feel like society is pressuring them to have kids, and a lot of people who do want kids feel like (other parts of) society are pressuring them not to. I think society should take a chill pill and people should have however many kids they want.

Mrx [writes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3205382):

> The argument about future elections seems flawed. It is not an accident that elections are very close: the parties are strongly incentivised to position themselves in a way that appeals to approximately the number of people they need to win elections. If you removed 1% of the electorate's left wing, the Democrats wouldn't sit there losing elections for ever, they'd just move slightly to the right until they picked up enough centrists to restore the equilibrium. So there is an effect on policy outcomes, but it's roughly proportional to the population change rather than being hugely amplified by elections as claimed.

This is a good point, which several people brought up.

I‚Äôm not sure how to think of the Median Voter Theorem right now, for a few reasons. 

First, the MVT assumes that both parties will end up as indistinguishable centrists, but this clearly hasn‚Äôt happened, probably because of the primary process. Probably it‚Äôs trivial to extend MVT into a world where this happens, but it‚Äôs a trivial thing I haven‚Äôt done and am not completely sure about.

Second, often elections _aren‚Äôt_ close. As a commenter brings up in that thread, the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nonstop for 38 years from 1955 - 1993. Reagan won the 1984 election by 525 to 13 (and AFAICT MVT should be aiming at the median electoral vote in an electoral system). I think some of this has to do with irrational emotions - ie the South hated Republicans so much after Lincoln and the Civil War that Democrats could do whatever they wanted and still win there. But there sure are a lot of irrational emotions in politics today and I wouldn‚Äôt want to count this factor out.

Third, I‚Äôm not sure how to think about this particular issue. Washington State proposed a carbon tax a few years ago, and it failed 56 to 44. Suppose that a bunch of pro-carbon-tax activists equal to 7% of the population moved in the next day. How would this change politics? Would the climate change activists propose something even more ambitious, so that chance of success is held constant? And is there a binary distribution here, such that ‚Äúcarbon tax‚Äù is going to offend some people and excite others no matter what the rate is, and so it‚Äôs hard to get something that is ‚Äúlike a carbon tax but appeals to 6% more voters‚Äù?

I bet political scientists have good answers to all these questions, but I don‚Äôt know them.

This also reminded me of the recent [Ezra Klein piece on David Shor](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html). Shor is telling Democrats that if they took more popular positions they could get more votes; Democrats‚Äô response has been mixed:

> Many in the Democratic data world simply disagree that policy communication holds the power Shor believes it does or that the popularity of a message is as important as he thinks it is.
> 
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no argument that saying unpopular things is better than saying popular things. My argument is it‚Äôs not close to being an important enough factor to warrant attention,‚Äù [Democratic bigwig Michael] Podhorzer told me. ‚ÄúIf the object is for Democrats to win, that‚Äôs a tertiary, at best, factor.‚Äù [...]
> 
> Shor‚Äôs critics argue that he‚Äôs too focused on the popularity of what Democrats say, rather than the enthusiasm it can unleash. When pressed, Podhorzer called this theory ‚Äúviralism‚Äù and pointed to Trump as an example of what it can see that popularism cannot. ‚ÄúA lot of things Trump did were grossly unpopular but got him enormous turnout and support from the evangelical community,‚Äù Podhorzer said. ‚ÄúPolling is blind to that. Politics isn‚Äôt just saying a thing at people who‚Äôre evaluating it rationally. It‚Äôs about creating energy. Policy positions don‚Äôt create energy.‚Äù

I‚Äôve written about this [here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/10/change-minds-or-drive-turnout/), where I think the research agrees with Shor, but the road from ‚Äúthe median voter changes‚Äù to ‚Äúthe parties change their position‚Äù seems surprisingly treacherous.

> Not having children because of climate change hysteria just means the Earth gets inherited by people less susceptible to such maladaptive mind viruses, i.e. it is self-defeating at the most fundamental level.

This is basically a eugenics argument (we want the next generation to have good genes), so I think it‚Äôs fair to respond to it with another eugenics argument.

The people refusing to have kids because of climate change are some of the most intelligent and ethical people around. This is my assessment from knowing some of them, plus my inference from all the articles about them which usually mentions how they went to top colleges. And by definition, they‚Äôre people who really care about helping others and are willing to make major sacrifices to do so.

These are exactly the sort of people whose genes I want in the next generation. And if this article successfully catches the ones most likely to change their mind in response to evidence, even better!

Justin [writes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3203033):

> Good points, but I have to question the methodology on per capita emissions by state/DC. It seems likely that these numbers are based only on generation specifically within the boundary which would creating a misleading impression of standard of living attainable relative to emissions. For example Wyoming imports 14x more energy than it consumes, whereas DC imports almost all of its energy ([EIA.gov](http://eia.gov)). 2/3 of DC's electricity mix is fossil fuel <https://www.pjm.com/~/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/20170330-pjms-evolving-resource-mix-and-system-reliability.ashx> DC is uses more electricity per capita than 89% of the country, but since it's all imported that seems to not be counted.
> 
> This holds true for all the high use states, they export coal or gas, or refine crude oil, to be used in other areas of the country. NY's numbers don't include the carbon from the millions of yards they use annually, steel from Pennsylvania, or the incineration or burial of their rubbish at out-of-state facilities.
> 
> I've also always questioned how flights play into this, even though the share of emissions is relatively small. Rural residents do drive much more, but rarely fly. Half the US never flies. Based on my anecdotal experiences in NYC and DC it seems likely that they account for an outsize share of these emissions as well, although I can't find data on this beyond broad emissions stats - <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/17/climate/flying-shame-emissions.html>

Thanks. After checking this information I agree this is sketchy and that what state you live in matters less than I thought for how much CO2 you emit. 

As far as I know the [urban vs. rural carbon calculations](https://www.livescience.com/13772-city-slicker-country-bumpkin-smaller-carbon-footprint.html) do correct for this, and so urban-dwellers will still emit somewhat less than the US average, but someone can tell me if I‚Äôm wrong.

Several people argued I was underestimating the downsides of climate change. Scri [writes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids/comment/3203128):

> I definitely agree with the general thrust of your argument, that the damage caused by climate change is not going to be so terrible that you shouldn't have children, but I would quibble the point about climate change being unlikely to affect peoples lives in the west.
> 
> Climate migration, and food and water insecurity, both have potential as destabilising political forces. Add into this the political dysfunction in the US, and you could get into a situation where these problems, which are solvable to be sure, don't get dealt with in an effective way. I think that could lead to many kinds of disruption in peoples day to day lives, and I don't think that that's a scenario that is totally unrealistic.

I agree that I didn‚Äôt do a great job addressing concerns about global warming somewhere in between ‚Äúbad for Third Worlders but not for you‚Äù and ‚Äúeveryone dies‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt seen these fleshed out very well (maybe someone did flesh them out, but I haven‚Äôt seen it).

I tried to explain in the post that the First World is really, really far away from significant food and water shortages. ‚ÄúThe government pays farmers not to grow crops‚Äù still sounds like a 90‚Äôs era conservative talking point, but it‚Äôs still true, and the Biden administration has [increased not-growing-crops payments to be higher than ever](https://thecounter.org/biden-administration-farmers-conservation-reserve-crp-usda-vilsack/). Right now we only eat [about a third](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6053187/cropland-map-food-fuel-animal-feed) of our crops directly - the rest goes mostly to animals, usually requiring about 10x calories of grain to produce x calories of meat. There are currently many foods that can give a day‚Äôs worth of calories for about $2, meaning that the cost of food could dectuple and still be affordable on minimum wage. I‚Äôm not sure how much more I can stress how far we are from practical First World food and water shortages. 

I agree the Third World could run into a lot of problems. Many people brought up the prospect of climate refugees affecting quality of life in developed countries. I guess I have a pretty cynical perspective on this, which is that - we‚Äôve already proven developed countries will reject refugees long before they start to have any significant economic impact. Refugees seem to be something we take zero chances with, something where we‚Äôre heavily biased towards rejecting them at the slightest sign that maybe someone thinks something might possibly be affecting vague unmeasurable qualities. If we ever approached a point where refugees could actually cause techno-economic decline or civil war or whatever, we would have already built a giant unscaleable border wall. I don‚Äôt think our civilization should necessarily be proud of this, but I think it‚Äôs true and makes the threat of climate refugees less impactful.

A few people have claimed that one danger actually _is_ that the flood of climate refugees will put right-wing governments into power. I guess that if you don‚Äôt like right-wing governments, think left-wing parties are too principled to take anti-refugee positions, and think the median voter theorem is imperfect, then this is a real risk.

> I was also struck some years ago by a piece written by William Nordhaus responding to a WSJ OpEd that argued that climate change was not a catastrophe requiring immediate response. His calculation at the time was that the net cost of doing nothing for fifty years instead the optimal policy starting immediately was about $4.1 trillion. Spread out over a century and the entire world, that works out to a reduction of average world GNP of about one twentieth of one percent. He didn't put it that way. You can find my comments on his piece and a link to it at:

I broadly agree with this. The direct effects on world GDP will be low.

My concern is something more like: one commenter brought up [the 1980s Ethiopia famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983%E2%80%931985_famine_in_Ethiopia), which killed about a million people (also, ‚Äú400,000 refugees left the country‚Ä¶2.5 million people were internally displaced, [and] almost 200,000 children were orphaned.‚Äù) Climatologists suspect a major contributor to the famine was [global dimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming), a phenomenon where air pollution decreases sunlight over certain parts of the world.

So here are various true things you can say about global dimming:

  * It probably cost less than a trillion dollars and less than 0.1% of GWP

  * If we‚Äôd made any really serious efforts to prevent it, those efforts would have cost more, in monetary terms, than the dimming itself

  * For all we know it improved the climates of other parts of the world and made them better off, who knows? Maybe some deserts were able to grow more plants because global dimming made them less scorching.

  * In the grand scheme of things, most people didn‚Äôt notice it. It didn‚Äôt bring down civilization, or cause technological collapse. I had never heard of it until right now, and there‚Äôs no real reason I should have.

  * The famine was mostly the fault of communism and an incompetent government destroying Ethiopia‚Äôs agricultural sector, which made it extra vulnerable to global-dimming-induced drought. If we had only had global dimming and not these other vulnerabilities, it would have been fine.

  * We will never actually be able to know for sure whether the Ethiopia famine would have happened anyway without global dimming. Wikipedia cites a claim that dimming was the ‚Äúleading factor‚Äù in the famine, but other sources go quite into depth about the climatological causes of the famine without even mentioning it.




But, also:

  * There‚Äôs a pretty decent chance that global dimming killed like a million people.




My expectation for global warming is that it will be a few times worse than global dimming, but basically follow the same dynamics. In 2100 or whenever, we developed-country-citizens will still be alive, we‚Äôll still be squinting really hard to see if global warming made a difference in economic growth, and there will be several million people dead from disasters that we suspect (but will never be sure) that global warming made more likely or worsened. 

Preventing global warming will never seem cost-effective because the global economy just doesn‚Äôt place a very high value on the lives of Ethiopian subsistence farmers. But we can choose place a high value on their lives, and I think if we do that then preventing global warming seems worth it in expectation.

I am much less certain of any of this than I am certain that it‚Äôs funny that the hurricane report is by a guy named ‚ÄúLandsea‚Äù

> I looked into this during a previous California drought and my (very limited) understanding is that alfalfa is an important part of crop rotation in California because it sucks salt out of the ground very effectively. CA starts with high salt content and other crops raise the salt content more, which risks ‚Äúsalting the land‚Äù and wrecking the soil. I‚Äôm sure there are other crop mixes and intensiveness that could work, but the issue isn‚Äôt alfalfa specifically.

Thank you. I had previously used ‚ÄúCalifornia devotes a lot of water to growing alfalfa‚Äù as an argument that we waste resources, since alfalfa mostly goes to cows and is very inefficient. But it sounds like there‚Äôs a good reason for this, so I‚Äôll leave this point out of future arguments unless someone convinces me there isn‚Äôt.

> Exactly, life will be slightly harder and will get harder until we reach an equilibrium or intervene to prevent further climate change. A slightly worse economy probably also means the cost of having a child increases even further into absurdity i.e people with children will burden *more* of the climate change induced costs even if the average person isn't effected much.

I think the first sentence is claiming there‚Äôs an equilibrium - if climate change ever gets so bad that it starts inconveniencing people more than attempts to fix climate change would, we‚Äôll act.

I think the flaw here is that it takes a lot of time to act to stop climate change. Both in terms of the physical action (eg transitioning from fossil fuel plants to solar plants) and in terms of emissions (CO2 emitted today stays in the atmosphere and keeps warming the planet for decades to centuries). If we start acting once climate change becomes un-ignorably bad, it will be decades before we see any results. And by that time, things will have gotten worse and we will have wished we‚Äôd done even _more_. The only exception might be fairly extreme geo-engineering attempts that we‚Äôll wish we didn‚Äôt have to experiment with. I think trying to respond to climate change early is the right call.

> I really support people having children even in the face of the climate crisis. However, I think the strongest argument that I have heard so far is that children are just a high opportunity cost and the money and time spent on them should go into activism, since we are at a decisive moment for how bad it will be. Is there a counter to this argument?

I agree that it‚Äôs true that time/energy spent raising children inevitably trades off against time/energy spent doing charity work.

But if you weren‚Äôt doing charity work 100% of the time already, then you can sacrifice some other thing you were doing in order to raise children. If you‚Äôre not doing very much charity work at all right now, then, well, no problem, is there?

My personal preference is to decide how much time/energy/money I want to spend on charity (I‚Äôve settled on 10% of money; time and energy are harder to budget), and then spend the rest of it however I want. If I want to spend my money on a giant diamond or something else useless like that, I don‚Äôt have to feel bad about being privileged or wasteful (or at least no worse than I would feel if I spent it on something tasteful like a flower garden for my house) because it‚Äôs all coming out of the same 90% non-charity budget.

I think most people only put a tiny amount of their effort into charity, meaning that they have a big budget of slack to reallocate without harming their charitable efforts. If you want to allocate some of that to having kids, I think that‚Äôs as acceptable as any other choice. Maybe kids are such a big choice that it‚Äôs inevitable that some of the cost would bleed into your other projects, and I do think that‚Äôs a risk, but I also know cases where they don‚Äôt. Elon Musk has seven kids, and he‚Äôs no slacker.

Thanks for this correction. Several other people pointed out that even if sea level does rise this much, it doesn‚Äôt mean much - many cities are already below sea level and protected by seawalls. Expanding them enough to be prepared for sea level rise will be expensive, but in most cases it‚Äôll be a lot more cost-effective than letting cities drown.

> Matt Yglesias touches on this in One Billion Americans. He argues that climate change can only be solved by technological progress. Even if America cut its population by 50%, there are billions of people in south Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa whose lives are rapidly improving, and therefore will see their emissions per capita increase. It's unethical to try and thwart this improvement in their lives, and so the only way to fix climate change is through technological innovation. And the best way to achieve innovation is with _more people_ not less. Yglesias therefore encourages policies to make it easier for Americans to have children, but also to increase immigration to the largest technologically innovative economy.
> 
> Edit: I believe he also makes his more generalized case that we have to accept political realities, and that most Americans don't actually want to reduce their energy consumption by 50 or 90%. The solution then is massive renewable energy abundance (including nuclear and geothermal!), along the trends we've seen in the last 20 years, not degrowth through actions or population.

> I'm reminded again of C.S. Lewis's "[How Will The Bomb Find You?](https://www.crossroads.net/media/articles/how-will-the-bomb-find-you)" essay. It was quoted a fair bit in light of coronavirus fears, but I think it applies even better to climate change:
> 
> _In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. ‚ÄòHow are we to live in an atomic age?‚Äô I am tempted to reply: ‚ÄòWhy, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year [...]; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents._
> 
> _In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented‚Ä¶ It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty._
> 
> _[...] If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things‚Äîpraying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts‚Äînot huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs._
> 
> To be clear, this doesn't preclude advocating sensible policies about climate change (or sensible precautions against a virus), any more than C.S. Lewis would have opposed sensible policies about nuclear weapons.
> 
> But I think this question of "can I even have children" speaks to a way that people are being eaten by fear over climate change in a way that goes beyond mere sensible policies.

Man, I wish I could write like this. Seems like a waste to blog when one could be quoting CS Lewis instead.
