This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

 **1:** Correction to [Unintuitive Properties Of Polygenic Disorders](/p/some-unintuitive-properties-of-polygenic): if schizophrenia is 80-20 genetic, that means genes matter 2x as much as the environment, not the more intuitive 4x, [see here for more](/p/some-unintuitive-properties-of-polygenic/comment/48011469). This somewhat invalidates my simulations, but in a way that makes my point stronger rather than weaker, so whatever. See also [this commenter’s more sophisticated model](/p/some-unintuitive-properties-of-polygenic/comment/48056811).

 **2:** Correction to [Psychopolitics Of Trauma](/p/the-psychopolitics-of-trauma): The study I cited on people making more errors in political reasoning [failed to replicate](/p/the-psychopolitics-of-trauma/comment/48053016) (more discussion [here](https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1750721484773888174)). I cited that as an example of a larger literature about political reasoning errors (see eg [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/role-of-evidence-in-politics-motivated-reasoning-and-persuasion-among-politicians/6813A080C058E1BB4920661FF60BED6F)), but for all I know that larger literature doesn’t replicate either. I do think that [the Wason task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task) (which does replicate) suggests context-dependent reasoning errors like these should be common. See also [Part V of this post](/p/on-hreha-on-behavioral-economics) for more on how I think of these kinds of questions.

 **3:** Correction to [Should The Future Be Human](/p/should-the-future-be-human): As part of my argument that humans would not merge with AIs, I cited our multi-thousand year history of not merging with earlier tools like swords and guns. But LosTiburon on [the Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RTKtdut) was able to find [this story about a medieval Italian man merging with a knife](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-medieval-italian-man-replaced-his-amputated-hand-with-a-knife). ACX regrets the error.

 **4:** New subscriber-only post: [Your Name Was Changed At Ellis Island](/p/your-name-was-changed-at-ellis-island), a short fiction story based on [this from Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/01/no-ones-name-was-changed-at-ellis-island.html).

 **5:** ACX Grantee _Seeds of Science_ asks me to make the following announcement:

> " _[Seeds of Science](http://theseedsofscience.org/)_ would like to announce a new initiative for supporting independent researchers - the SoS Research Collective ([announcement post](https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/p/announcing-the-sos-research-collective)). In brief, members of the Collective receive the following: a title (SoS Research Fellow) and profile page on our website, payment of $50 for each peer-reviewed article published in the SoS journal (learn more about our format and review process [here](https://www.theseedsofscience.org/howtopublish)), editing and advising services, and promotion on the [SoS Substack](https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/). Independent researchers and early-career academics who conduct research activities outside of their academic work are welcome to apply. To apply, shoot us an email ([info@theseedsofscience.org](mailto:info@theseedsofscience.org)) that tells us who you are and what your research is about—CV, website, blog, twitter, etc.—and we will go from there.   
>

> _[Seeds of Science](https://www.theseedsofscience.org/)_ is also looking for more authors to feature on its [Best of Science Blogging feed](https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/s/the-best-of-science-blogging) \- please reach out and share some of your work if you would like to be considered ([info@theseedsofscience.org](http://info@theseedsofscience.org))"

 **6:** I’m still waiting for some technical issues to get resolved for this year’s ACX Grants. Depending on how that goes, I’ll post results either this Friday, or next Friday.

 **7:** All Middle East-related Open Thread comments still need to be contained on [the Middle East subthread](/p/open-thread-313/comment/48369120).
