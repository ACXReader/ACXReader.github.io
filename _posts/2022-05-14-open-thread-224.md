**1:** There’s a great new article out on effective altruism and the Carrick Flynn campaign: [The Esoteric Social Movement Behind This Cycle’s Most Expensive House Race](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/12/carrick-flynn-save-world-congress-00031959). “Flynn . . . remains confident that even a small number of lawmakers, armed with the ideas of effective altruism, can bend the hinge away from destruction and back toward flourishing.” And my friend Miranda interviewed him [here](https://www.vox.com/23066877/carrick-flynn-effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-congress-house-election-2022), along with Dylan Matthews from Vox. Although the articles mention his generous PAC support, Flynn can’t use that money himself, and he still needs a last infusion of direct funding for his real campaign before the election on Tuesday. If interested, [please donate here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/flynn-web), up to a maximum of $2900 for the primary and general. I think this is important enough that I’ve donated _and_ moved the Open Thread a day early to get this announcement out when it can still do some good.

**2:** DeepMind’s AI alignment team is [hiring researchers and software engineers](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BA7kPQsoqSuScK6rz/deepmind-is-hiring-for-the-scalable-alignment-and-alignment).
