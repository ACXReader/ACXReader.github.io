This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Thanks to everyone who commented [on this year’s ACX Grants](/p/acx-grants-results-2024). Reminder that you can go to [Manifund ](https://manifund.com/causes/acx-grants-2024)to learn more about ACX Grants projects, comment on individual efforts, and donate to the ones that need more funding.

**2:**~~Related: I have a few (hopefully very short) questions for an attorney who knows things about charity and tax deductions. I would be happy to pay your normal rate. If you’re willing to help, please email me at scott@slatestarcodex.com.~~ Already got a volunteer, thank you everyone who emailed me!
