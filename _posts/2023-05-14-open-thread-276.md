This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Thanks to everyone who helped rate book reviews. Using your feedback, I’ve selected sixteen finalists. The list is in [this comment](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-276/comment/16002370). I’ll post the first on Friday, and 1 - 2 more every week after that.

**2:** Thanks to everyone who voted on my housing economics poll from [this post](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-housing). In the specific scenario I mentioned, 55% of people thought building the houses would lower prices, 25% weren’t sure / it depends, and 20% thought it would raise prices. I made a mistake on the question about whether respondents had an econ degree, but among people who responded after I corrected it, the numbers were: no degree: 58/21/21, undergrad degree: 62/26/12, advanced degree: 81/14/5. Based on this I’m updating heavily towards “lower”.

**3:** New meetups that have been organized since last time: Athens, Cape Town. Times, dates, and locations are all still [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/berkeley-meetup-this-saturday-27e).

**4:** Manifold Markets and Charity Entrepreneurship are hosting a tournament (top prize $1000) to see if prediction markets can help select among charity ideas. [See here](https://manifold.markets/group/ce-2023-top-ideas) (and press the Read More button) for more.
