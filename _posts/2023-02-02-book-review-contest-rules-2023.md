Sure, this seemed to go well last the last few times, let's do it again.

Write a review of a book. Any book you like - most past winners have been nonfiction, but maybe you can change that! There’s no official word count requirement, but previous finalists and winners were often between 2,000 and 10,000 words. There’s no official recommended style, but check the style of [last year’s finalists and winners](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-contest-2022-winners) or my ACX book reviews ([1](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-lifespan), [2](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-which-country-has-the), [3](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-arabian-nights)) if you need inspiration. Please limit yourself to one entry per person or team.

Then send me your review through [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/EY5LMzbJQvgYkgxt5). The form will ask for your name, email, the title of the book, and a link to a Google Doc. The Google Doc should have your review exactly as you want me to post it if you’re a finalist. DON’T INCLUDE YOUR NAME OR ANY HINT ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY IN THE GOOGLE DOC ITSELF, ONLY IN THE FORM. I want to make this contest as blinded as possible, so I’m going to hide that column in the form immediately and try to judge your docs on their merit.

(does this mean you can’t say something like “This book about war reminded me of my own experiences as a soldier” because that gives a hint about your identity? My rule of thumb is - if I don’t know who you are, and the average ACX reader doesn’t know who you are, you’re fine. I just want to prevent my friends or Internet semi-famous people from getting an advantage. If you’re in one of those categories and think your personal experience would give it away, please don’t write about your personal experience.)

PLEASE MAKE SURE THE GOOGLE DOC IS UNLOCKED AND I CAN READ IT. By default, nobody can read Google Docs except the original author. You’ll have to go to Share, then on the bottom of the popup click on “Restricted” and change to “Anyone with the link”. If you send me a document I can’t read, I will probably disqualify you, sorry.

First prize will get at least $2,500, second prize at least $1,000, third prize at least $500; I might increase these numbers later on. All winners and finalists will get free publicity (including links to any other works you want me to link to) and free ACX subscriptions. And all winners will get the right to pitch me new articles if they want (nobody ever takes me up on this).

Your due date is **April 5th**. Good luck! If you have any questions, ask them in the comments. And remember, the form for submitting entries is [here](https://forms.gle/EY5LMzbJQvgYkgxt5).
