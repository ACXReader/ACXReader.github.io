This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

 **1:** Several good comments on the Poverty and Infant EEG post, eg [Rahien Din](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/against-that-poverty-and-infant-eegs/comment/4696231):

>  _I can actually offer some operator-level expertise! I am a board-certified pediatric epileptologist, and can describe what EEG actually is and what it is purported to measure. And why this study is bullshit. I hit the comment length limit so this will have to be threaded out_ [[read more](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/against-that-poverty-and-infant-eegs/comment/4696231)]

But see also this response [by one of the study coauthors](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/against-that-poverty-and-infant-eegs/comment/4780873).

But also, a few people including [Lehm point out](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/against-that-poverty-and-infant-eegs/comment/4692262) I was sloppy on my description of how National Academy of Sciences membership affects the requirement for peer review. And [AMac78 on](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/against-that-poverty-and-infant-eegs/comment/4696736) how much money the participants made.

 **2:** And thanks to everyone who participated in the [Classified Thread](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/classifieds-thread-12022). A few highlights:
