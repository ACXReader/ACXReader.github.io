This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

 **1:** Some good comments on [the Rene Girard book review](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like). Given the generally [anti-Girard reception](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43802546), I was grateful for the few people who stepped up to defend or explain him. Skaladom [recommends ](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43957553)a professional Girard exegete named Johnathan Bi ([lectures here](https://johnathanbi.com/lectures)). Neil Scott [notes ](/p/open-thread-303/comment/43963909)that Sam Kriss has [a recent Girard article](https://harpers.org/archive/2023/11/overwhelming-and-collective-murder-rene-girard/). Deiseach on [memetic crisis](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43878793) and [Girard’s theology](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43841811), Zbigniew Lukasiak on [the social usefulness of religion](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43834757), and Hal Johnson [suggesting other books](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43810464). And thanks to Bill Benzon [for highlighting](/p/book-review-i-saw-satan-fall-like/comment/43806386) that Tyler Cowen [considers Girard](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/03/contributions-rene-girard.html) one of the top twenty thinkers of the second half of the 20th century. I would love to know more about Tyler’s interpretation of Girard and the single-victim process. Maybe in the context of recent events?

 **2:** And some good comments on the ketamine post. Thomas Reilly [says the study was underpowered](https://rationalpsychiatry.substack.com/p/the-powerful-and-the-damned). Awais Aftab compares to [a recent very positive trial of ketamine vs. ECT](https://awaisaftab.substack.com/p/is-ketamine-as-good-as-placebo-or). Eremolalos [on a meta-analysis](/p/does-anaesthesia-prove-ketamine-placebo/comment/43664284). Nate Praschan argues that [anaesthetics might block ketamine directly](/p/does-anaesthesia-prove-ketamine-placebo/comment/43662475).

 **3:** Condolences to everyone in AI right now, I hope you’re all okay.
