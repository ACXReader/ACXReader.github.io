This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** A message from ACX Grantee [1DaySooner:](https://www.1daysooner.org/) California is considering a law to ban things that emit ozone. As unintentional collateral damage, this bill would ban [far-UV light](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23972651/ultraviolet-disinfection-germicide-far-uv), a new disinfection technology that can potentially eliminate all indoor respiratory diseases, but which also creates trivial amounts of ozone. Far UV is almost ready for deployment, and could potentially save tens of thousands of lives yearly. 1DaySooner, a health-related charity, is [trying](https://www.1daysooner.org/1day-sooners-comments-on-sb-1308-and-effects-on-germicidal-uv-light-technology/) to convince the California government to exempt it from this law, or at least to remember that it exists when writing the exact text of the bill. They are asking Californians to write to their representative about this. Representative [Buffy Wicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_Wicks) is on a relevant committee, and support from her constituents (Berkeley, Richmond, and north Oakland) would be especially helpful. I’ll post more information - including what you can say to your representative - as a comment below.

**2:** Thanks again to everyone who purchased _Unsong_. And my former co-blogger Ozy has also published a novella this month, _[Her Voice Is A Backwards Record](https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/announcement-ozy-has-written-a-novella)_ , “an adaptation of Neil Sinhababu’s paper [Possible Girls](https://philpapers.org/archive/SINPG.pdf)” about whether “if modal realism is true, can I have a loving relationship with someone from another possible world?”

**3:** New subscribers-only post: [Contra Hoel On Nerd Culture](/p/contra-hoel-on-nerd-culture).

**4:** Thanks to everyone who came to the meetup last week - and it was good to see some of you at Manifest too. I’m continually grateful to the venue, [Lighthaven](https://www.lighthaven.space/), for hosting ACX meetups for free. They’re looking for more customers; if you’re doing a conference or event in the Bay Area, please check them out.
