This is the bimonthly (?) classifieds thread. Advertise whatever you want in the comments.

I’m experimenting with being more organized this time, so please respond to the appropriate top-level comment:**Employment, Dating, Read My Blog**(also includes podcasts, books, etc)**, Consume My Product/Service,** or **Other.**

Remember that posting dating ads is hard and scary. Please refrain from commenting too negatively on anyone’s value as a human being. I’ll be much less strict about employers, bloggers, etc.

And here are some extra dating profiles of people I know and like:
