---
Lots of people only want to go to meetups a few times a year. And they all want to go to the same big meetups as all the other people who only go a few times a year. In 2021, we set up one big well-telegraphed meetup in the fall as a Schelling point for these people.

This year, we’re setting up two. We’ll have the fall meetup as usual. If you only want to go to one meetup a year, go to that one. But we’ll also have a spring round. If you only go to two meetups a year, come to this one too!

You can find a list of cities and times below. If you want to add your city to the list, fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6bVGranNA5AKTKj8l4XtTzvXBaRsap48rEvbP5gqA2JTiEQ/viewform); if you have questions, ask meetupsmingyuan@gmail.com.
