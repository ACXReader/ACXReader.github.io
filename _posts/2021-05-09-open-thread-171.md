This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

 **1:** Comments of the week: EHarding [points out](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-a-brief-history-of-neoliberalism#comment-1893923) some misconceptions about the post-war US economy that I fell victim to. People who didn’t like my _Neoliberalism_ review pointed to [RedfordCastle’s comment](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-a-brief-history-of-neoliberalism#comment-1894176) as the best rebuttal, so check that out for the other side. 

**2:** And Jack links to [graphs of GDP growth in various world regions](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-a-brief-history-of-neoliberalism#comment-1893785) , showing that a common pattern is good growth until ~1980, poor growth until ~2002, then good growth until ~2012, then poor growth again. Relevant to the _Neoliberalism_ review because neoliberalism took hold ~1980, and the book was written ~2002, so it would have been tempting to think neoliberalism = poor growth. The post-2002 growth complicates this picture - but what’s a better explanation for this pattern, and where can I learn more about it?

 **3:** The Substack team noticed that lots of good programmers hang out here, and asked me to signal-boost that they’re hiring [full stack engineers](https://jobs.lever.co/substackinc/69f5ed72-9a51-404d-9db1-20aedb329798) and various other [technical and non-technical jobs](https://substack.com/jobs). Please work for them so they can add lots of new features I can benefit from.
