This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** Last month I wrote a post, [Jhanas And The Dark Room Problem](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/jhanas-and-the-dark-room-problem), about some of Andrés Gomez Emilsson’s theories. Anders has since written a post of his own giving longer commentary on some of the things I said and explaining his theories in more length. [Check it out](https://qualiacomputing.com/2021/10/31/on-dark-rooms-jhanas-ecstasy-and-the-symmetry-theory-of-valence/)!

**2:** The effective altruism movement is launching [EA Virtual Programs](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/virtual-programs/), some online courses and discussion groups and book clubs and so on. If interested, apply before November 28.

**3:** Still a lot of pushback on the [Great Families](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/secrets-of-the-great-families) [posts](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-great) (one of the most common comments on the ivermectin post was “this is so much more evidence-based than that family stuff”). I’m wondering if I’ve been blogging so long and cast such a wide net that I’ve collected readers who aren’t familiar with _[The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/Nurture-Assumption-Children-Revised-Updated/dp/1439101655/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nurture+assumption&qid=1637476994&qsid=138-4927381-2675209&sr=8-1&sres=1439101655%2CB0000544S3%2CB002LHRLO8%2CB096M1LDQQ%2CB07PGQY9L4%2C006081246X%2C8497592123%2C0553386697%2CB0735KLL9B%2C0812979680%2CB01MSL3XOH%2C0062560751%2CB01CKZM39I%2C1785042211%2C0674980158%2CB08MQ5K327&srpt=ABIS_BOOK) (_book full of evidence that parenting styles and effects of early home environment don’t matter for most outcomes later in life, within normal bounds) - anyone know of a good refresher I can link people to? But maybe some of you want to argue they matter for the top 0.01% - small enough that nobody will ever notice in a study, but enough to explain Darwins and Huxleys? 

(Related: [new study confirms](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/1461639134297079809) no association between parenting and Big Five personality traits)

**4:** Also, several people pointed out that an ideal experiment would involve taking a really talented family, adopting away one of their kids at birth, and seeing what happened to them. I know of one case almost like this. Mathematician [Paul Nemenyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nemenyi) was one of [the Martians](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/), a group of supersmart Hungarian Jews who revolutionized mid-20th-century physics. His legitimate son [Peter Nemenyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Nemenyi) was a prominent statistician who invented the [Nemenyi test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemenyi_test) (which I have never heard of, but which is apparently the same as the Wilcoxon test, which I vaguely have). But Paul also had an affair that produced an illegitimate child, who was raised entirely by his mother without any contact with the other Nemenyis: [Bobby Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer), later world chess champion. It’s unclear if Fischer ever knew he was a Nemenyi relative, although Paul Nemenyi seemed to. I don’t know of any other good examples of this - unless the [Justin Trudeau - Fidel Castro conspiracy theory](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/no-internet-fidel-castro-isnt-trudeaus-real-father-the-canadian-prime-minister-just-really-really-looks-like-him) turns out to be true (it isn’t).

**5:** Deadline for applying for an [ACX Grant](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/apply-for-an-acx-grant) is end of day this Thursday.
