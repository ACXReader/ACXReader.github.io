_**[Meetup COVID alerts** : I’ve been informed that someone at the Salt Lake City meetup may have had COVID. Please let me know if you have any other information about COVID at meetups and I will list it here.] _

Thanks to everyone who responded to my [request for](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/outdoor-careful-meetups-everywhere) ACX outdoor meetup organizers. Volunteers have arranged meetups in 170 cities around the world, including beautiful Lusk, Wyoming (population: 1,526). [You can see the full list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSMKpBkT5y4yOIcUYqKGzuyZ7jdZTKSrp-bASqY6Y5VV0ta6_hNwVWWMI2wQDzj21TaA4lMS-KSio/pubhtml), and I’ll also have it below in case you can’t access the spreadsheet for some reason.

I’ll be trying to attend ~15 of the 170 meetups. Since I focused on the US last time, I’m going to focus on Europe this year (plus a few US cities on the way). My _very provisional_ itinerary (all dates in US month/day format) is:

 **Berkeley:** Saturday 8/28, 1 PM **  
Boston:** Sunday 9/5, 5 PM **  
New York: **Monday 9/6, 5 PM **  
Washington DC:** Saturday **** 9/11, 5 PM **  
Lisbon:** Saturday 9/18, 5 PM **  
Madrid:** Saturday 9/25, 11 AM **  
Zurich:** Sunday 9/26, 5 PM **  
Vienna:** Saturday 10/2, 1 PM **  
Prague:** Sunday 10/3, 5 PM **  
Berlin:** Saturday 10/9, 1 PM **  
Paris:** Sunday 10/10, 5 PM **  
London:** Saturday 10/16, 1 PM  
 **Oxford:** Sunday 10/17, 5 PM **  
Cambridge:** Saturday 10/23, 1 PM **  
Edinburgh:** Sunday 10/24, 5 PM

Again, this is very provisional; I don’t want to make confident predictions about how quickly I can travel through Europe. Also, if COVID or something else comes up, I might have to drop some cities from my list, in which case I’ll let you know and you can have a normal meetup at whatever time works for you.

 **Extra Info For Potential Attendees**

 **1.** If you’re reading this, you’re invited. Please don’t feel like you “won’t be welcome” just because you’re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You’ll be fine!   
**2.** Please re-check [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QFbM5B9KfsiwqO6DvJ4D05dQitBtZ6kYDwXZ3Hj6SEc/edit#gid=1585750313) the day of/before the meetup. Some organizers might have to reschedule, updates are more likely to make it on the spreadsheet than to make it here, and the spreadsheet will be the canonical version if anything differs.  
 **3**. You don’t have to RSVP or contact the organizer if you don’t want to (unless the event description says otherwise); the RSVP links are just there to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up. I’ve also given email addresses for all organizers in case you have a question.   
**4.** Last time I went traveling, some people gave me very nice gifts. I’m very grateful, but please don’t do that this time – I’ll be going a long way with no extra room in my suitcase.

 **Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:  
  
1.** If you’re the host, bring a sign that says “ACX MEETUP” and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).  
 **2.** Bring blank labels and pens for nametags.  
 **3.** Pass around a sign-up sheet where everyone gives their name and email address, so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.  
 **4.** If it’s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and if you try to organize some kind of “fun” “event” it’ll probably just be annoying.  
 **5.** It’s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you’re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.  
 **6.** In case people want to get to know each other better outside the meetup, you might want to mention [reciprocity.io](https://www.reciprocity.io/), the rationalist friend-finder/dating site.   
**7.** To enable the RSVP system and send you email notifications for new RSVPs to your event, the LessWrong team created events and accounts for all the meetup organizers. You can claim your event and account by sending a message via the Intercom support chat in the bottom right corner of LessWrong, or by resetting your password with the email that you provided in the meetup organizer form.

If you have any questions about any of this, contact ACX Meetup Czar Mingyuan (meetupsmingyuan@gmail.com). And without further ado, here are the meetups you can attend (version below is less canonical than [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QFbM5B9KfsiwqO6DvJ4D05dQitBtZ6kYDwXZ3Hj6SEc/edit#gid=1585750313), trust the latter if anything differs):

I promise to check my inbox several times from 20:00 to 21:00 German time every day, so you should have ample time to send me an email, get a reply, and read it before your temp email removes the reply. If you want to do that multiple times over a span of time larger than your address remains alive, just generate a random alphanumeric string (look up password generators online), put it somewhere in the first email, and include it in subsequent ones, that way I could figure out same person is talking to me from multiple addresses.

Time: 4:30 PM, Saturday, September 11  
Location: Parco dei Canapé, at the open air cafe, ask the barista  
Notes: This is a long shot: I am not aware of such a meeting in central Italy. Foligno is the middle point of the entire area and it is very well connected, the goal is to attract ACX fans throughout the nearby regions. The park is only 800 meters from the train station so that public transport would be an excellent choice.

Go inside and ask them to show you to the outdoor seating area. We'll have a sign.
