This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

 **1:** Vienna meetup this Saturday, October 2, 1 PM, at [informal.courage.courage](https://w3w.co/informal.courage.courage), aka Wiener Stadtpark at the Strauss Monument; the organizer will have an ACX Meetup sign.

 **2:** And Prague meetup this Sunday, October 3, 5 PM, at [magnets.hurry.charm](https://w3w.co/magnets.hurry.charm), aka the garden of Dharamsala Teahouse. Please feel free to come to either of these even if you feel awkward about it, even if you’re not “the typical ACX reader”, even if you’re worried people won’t like you, etc, etc, etc. Mingyuan has added a Bangkok meetup, so if you’re in Thailand check it out. And regardless of where you are, check [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSMKpBkT5y4yOIcUYqKGzuyZ7jdZTKSrp-bASqY6Y5VV0ta6_hNwVWWMI2wQDzj21TaA4lMS-KSio/pubhtml) to find the closest meetup to you.
