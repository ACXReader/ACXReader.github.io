This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild. Otherwise, post about whatever you want. Also:

**1.** Thanks to everyone who commented on the amphetamines thread. The main things I learned: another way of thinking about the difference between racemic, d-, and meth- amphetamine is the [ratio of central to peripheral effects](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines#comment-1122928). One major reason druggies prefer methamphetamine to unsubstituted is because it’s [easier to make](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines#comment-1121820). I was wrong about Vyvanse; [it gets cleaved by red blood cells](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines#comment-1120873), not the liver. And one reader links me to this conspiracy theory (sorry, it’s actually very reasonable, I just can’t help thinking of it that way) that Vyvanse [doesn’t have superior pharmacokinetics to other amphetamines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5594082/) at all, and it’s all just Dexedrine + hype; I haven’t had enough time to examine the theory in depth but am interested in people’s thoughts. 

**2.** On the Taxometrics post, most interesting comment was probably from Duncan, who argues that pedophilia might not be as taxonic as it appears - it’s just that you wouldn’t admit you’re a pedophile (or come to anyone’s attention as a pedophile) unless you have such a severe case that there’s no way for you to hide it. This made me think about how many of the supposedly-taxonic conditions were also unusually stigmatizing conditions; draw your own conclusions.

**3.** And better late than never - I recently learned that one of the economists I cited on my wage stagnation post on Slate Star Codex (February 2019) chimed in with a great comment on explaining her work - you can [read it here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/#comment-735076).

**4.** Re: the series of Weyl posts - [nostalgebraist weighs in](https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/641769028753522688/on-weyls-why-i-am-not-a-technocrat). His explanation of what Weyl might have been trying to say helps it make more sense to me (which of course [makes it suspect](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/against-steelmanning/)).
