This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** I’m hoping to post a Highlights From The Comments On Orban thread sometime soon, but until then, [Lyman Stone’s Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1456701731358773251) is (predictably) a good place to start.

**2:** And I didn’t realize one of the authors of the genetics study I wrote about last week has [a FAQ about it](https://kph3k.medium.com/investigating-the-genetic-architecture-of-non-cognitive-skills-using-gwas-by-subtraction-b8743773ce44).

**3:** Interesting fact: last week’s open thread got 1,151 comments. The weeks before were 285, 576, 439, and 603. The main difference is that I posted it Sunday instead of Friday, and I didn’t combine it with a meetup announcement. The last two times I posted Sunday announcementless threads, I got 887 and 845. Maybe open threads with important announcements attached feel less open and hold people back from commenting? Weird that such a small thing can have such a big effect - tell me what else I should do to get you talking!
