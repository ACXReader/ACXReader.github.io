**2:** Wikipedia: [Atlantic Voyage Of The Predecessor Of Mansa Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_voyage_of_the_predecessor_of_Mansa_Musa). An unnamed king of the 14th century Malinese empire (maybe Mansa Mohammed?) sent a fleet of two hundred ships west into the Atlantic to discover what was on the other side. The sole returnee described the ships entering a ‚Äúriver‚Äù in the ocean (probably the Canary Current), which bore them away into parts unknown. The king decided to escalate and sent a fleet of two thousand ships to see what was on the other side of the river. None ever returned.

This helped me be less weirded out by [those studies](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hearing-colors-tasting-shapes/) proving synaesthesia is real because synaesthetes can find different numbers faster than others by checking the color. Sure, of course something like this should work! I‚Äôm not sure if I would describe the key as ‚Äúparallel search‚Äù so much as ‚Äúyour brain is doing lots of low-level visual processing and sending you high level summaries, and if you can trick it into doing the thing you want in the low-level processing then you‚Äôve significantly increased your available processing power.‚Äù

**7:** I**** still haven‚Äôt read Garett Jones‚Äô _The Culture Transplant_ yet, but I‚Äôm seeing a lot of good discussion. Via [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1620079886122745856), here‚Äôs a graph of migration-adjusted tech history score 1500 (ie how advanced a region was in 1500, adjusting for the fact that eg Australia is mostly inhabited by English people and should count as England rather than as the Aborigines) vs. income per person today (actually 2005):

But here‚Äôs [Alex Nowratesh‚Äôs counterargument](https://anowrasteh.substack.com/p/review-of-the-culture-transplant-184) (if, like me, you had a low opinion of Nowratesh based on his tweets, read it anyway - he is among the approximately 100% of people whose tweets are not their best work). I can‚Äôt tell which of them is closer to the obvious synthesis of ‚Äúdeep roots matter but institutions matter too‚Äù (remember, Puerto Rico is richer than most of the Caribbean, but it‚Äôs also poorer than most of the US!).

**8:** There‚Äôs a joke in _Fiddler on the Roof_ where someone asks the rabbi if there‚Äôs a blessing for the Czar, and the rabbi answers ‚ÄúGod bless and keep the Czar . . . far away from us!‚Äù But _is_ there a blessing for the Czar? The [Brachot On Sights](https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Brachot_on_Sights#cite_note-27) include the blessing for ‚Äúseeing a king or queen . . . whether they are Jewish or non-Jewish‚Äù, and the commentary says that in fact it‚Äôs a good deed to go see kings if one has the chance, because this will help one distinguish between regular kings and the Messiah. Related: the blessing for seeing [a crowd of 600,000 or more people](https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Brachot_on_Sights#cite_note-27) (different blessing depending on whether they‚Äôre Jews or Gentiles). Also, [the blessing for seeing a weird animal](https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Bracha_for_an_Unusual_Creature).

**9:** The Saami Council (Saami are the far northern Scandinavian people formerly known as Lapps) demands that the gaming company behind Final Fantasy 14 [remove traditional Saami clothing](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-saami-council-demands-square-enix-remove-far-northern-attire-from-final-fantasy-14) from their game (example below):

[![Far Northern Attire in Final Fantasy 14](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5e148be-6829-4517-8c89-43ba6e2cff9f_690x388)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5e148be-6829-4517-8c89-43ba6e2cff9f_690x388)

Aside from the wokeness angle, I find this to be an interesting intellectual property question; the Saami say that EU law gives them IP rights to their clothing. If gaming companies used an outfit trademarked by some fashion company without permission, I think the fashion company would be legally in the right to demand the game remove it, so I guess this hinges on whether you can consider a culture to be the sort of unit that can trademark things. Companies are allowed to claim rights to any product their employees invent, and I think universities do something similar, so it doesn‚Äôt seem like a stretch for a tribe to make a similar demand. I think probably the fair solution is for the US government to trademark every American cultural product (t-shirts! jeans! burgers!) and then tell the Saami they probably don‚Äôt want a trade war and we‚Äôll let them use our stuff (for example, draw a picture of a person in a t-shirt) only if they let us use theirs. Plus an extra lump sum bonus payment from them to us for making us go through this annoying process.

**11:** A few years ago I wrote about [attempts to make GPT-2 play chess](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/); it couldn‚Äôt consistently make legal moves, but when it did, its moves seemed better than random although still not great. Zack Witten reports [playing chess with Bing](https://twitter.com/zswitten/status/1631107663500304384) (either a late GPT-3 or an early GPT-4) and finds it‚Äôs much better - he reports consistently legal play with Elo of about 1100 (around the level of an okay beginner who‚Äôs stopped being too embarrassing). Other commenters report worse experiences and more illegal moves; I don‚Äôt have access to confirm.

**12:** Jonathan Haidt [revisits whether social media is bad for mental health](https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic). Previous studies have said no, by lumping together different ages, genders, types of screen time, and types of mental health result. Haidt finds a subgroup where the answer seems to be clearly yes: teenage girls using social media seem more depressed and anxious. I don‚Äôt usually like subgroup slicing but he seems to have done a really good job proving that this subgroup does badly across many different studies. He thinks this is because teenage girls are using Instagram and worrying about body image. I wouldn‚Äôt have predicted that this in particular would be so much worse than all the other kinds of social media use, but I guess I‚Äôm wrong!

**13:** New Eliezer Yudkowsky video appearance, shouldn‚Äôt be a big surprise to anyone who has already read his [Death With Dignity post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9Q8bRmwCgXRYAgcJ/miri-announces-new-death-with-dignity-strategy), but these people sure seemed surprised.

**17:** Public Intellectuals For Charity wants me to advertise their Dystopian Fact Checks series, where various public intellectuals including Steven Pinker, Robin Hanson, Robert Sapolsky, Coleman Hughes, etc will debate each other on Zoom to raise money for charity.[ See here for details](https://publicintellectualsforcharity.substack.com/p/steven-pinker-coleman-hughes-robert?sd=pf).

**18:** Jacob Falkovich on Twitter proposes a [Law Of Equal Sexual Oppression](https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1629544619217154049) \- in mostly heterosexual/monogamous societies, men and women ought to find dating equally hard/unpleasant/unrewarding. Proof: suppose dating was much harder and less rewarding for one sex; let‚Äôs say easy and rewarding for men, but hard and unrewarding for women. Many more men would enter the dating pool, and many women would leave. Now there are too many men chasing too few women; women would be ‚Äúin demand‚Äù, have all the power, and have the option to be much picker, causing dating to shift to norms which are better for women and worse for men, correcting the original imbalance. The only stable equilibrium is the one where both sexes are equally (un)happy!

Jacob adds many important caveats: for example, the unhappiness can take different forms (women have extra fear of being raped, men have the extra burden of having to work harder and face more rejections to get a date). And both sexes might have worse times within their own communities - women might be in female-dominated communities where the few men have it easier, and men might be in male-dominated communities where the few women have it easier.

A female friend counterargues that this isn‚Äôt how it works in real life: women in male-dominated communities may have dating market power which in theory they should be able to leverage into female-favoring dating norms, but actually male-dominated communities accrete so many basically-male foundational assumptions that the women can‚Äôt even communicate what they want at scale, and the men win out anyway. I‚Äôm not sure if this rebuts the Law Of Equal Sexual Oppression or confirms it.

**22:** Sasha Chapin: [I Cured My Aphantasia With a Low-Budget E-Course, Self-Therapy, and a Wee Bit of Microdosing](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/i-cured-my-aphantasia-with-a-low). I found this interesting not just for the title claim, but for his reflections on how he (a person who previously had aphantasia) was surprised by the character of mental imagery: ‚ÄúUsually people with aphantasia imagine that visualizing people are really _seeing_ images. Like, when they close their eyes, they don‚Äôt just see a black void. But that‚Äôs not true! Most people see a black void just like aphantasics do. They just have a _sense_ of an image alongside it, hovering in some imaginary parallel nether-space.‚Äù

**23:** Please stop citing that Swedish study purporting to show that IQ stops mattering after the 90th percentile or whatever! [Emil Kierkegaard has a summary](https://kirkegaard.substack.com/p/there-is-no-iq-threshold-effect-also) explaining the possible statistical missteps, and Cremieux has more information [here](https://cremieux.substack.com/p/income-and-iq-finnish-data) and (buried in the middle) [here](https://cremieux.substack.com/p/brief-data-post). 

But I worry that makes it sound like, if you don‚Äôt agree those particular statistical decisions are missteps, everything is okay. The actual situation is that study after study after study has always shown a pretty consistent relationship between IQ and income, and nobody cared or talked about it. Now one study finds a slight deviation from that relationship, and it went super-duper ultra-viral, to the point where I saw it posted _twice_ on the SSC subreddit, once on Marginal Revolution, and approximately one million times on Twitter. Many of these people are totally mis-describing the study as showing _no_ relationship between IQ and income - instead of a very strong relationship between IQ and income which deviates from perfect consistency at exactly the point where a common statistical misstep would make it deviate from perfect consistency. I think of this as a great illustration of the problem with science: a thousand studies confirming a point people don‚Äôt like can languish in obscurity; one bad study which gets a novel result that confirms people‚Äôs preferred narrative will become the only thing anyone ever hears about its entire field.

**24:** Related: [The Mensa Fallacy](https://kirkegaard.substack.com/p/the-mensa-fallacy). Many older studies show that very-high-IQ people are mentally imbalanced, bad at real-world tasks, or unambitious. Newer, more representative studies don‚Äôt show this. The most likely explanation: the older studies got their very-high-IQ samples from Mensa, the most convenient place to find lots of very-high-IQ subjects. But within the population of very-high-IQ people, Mensa is adversely selected for non-IQ traits; geniuses who are mentally healthy and ambitious are probably inventing quantum computers at MIT or making bank on Wall Street; it‚Äôs the geniuses who can‚Äôt make it in regular society who are going to every Mensa to boast about how quickly they can solve Rubik‚Äôs Cubes. Any study that uses a Mensa sample to study very-high-IQ people and conclude that they‚Äôre defective should be considered suspicious.

> A 1500 page screed against FDR, God, and non-BDSM sexual relationships . . . There is no way whatsoever that this should work. It breaks every unspoken rule of not just writing, but decency. And yet it works! She sold 37 million copies! [...] 
> 
> There are two possible explanations for Rand's success. The first is that her politics are just that compelling and her philosophy that overwhelming in its logic (they're not). The second is that her prose is just that good. That she's the American Tolstoy or Tolkien.

> Blue - data or information  
> Red - passion and strength

**30:**[Facebook And Instagram Are Testing Selling You Bluechecks For $12 A Month](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/19/23606268/meta-instagram-facebook-test-paid-verification). Musk‚Äôs two highest-profile Twitter changes - firing lots of people and selling bluechecks - seem to be going well and even getting adopted by other companies. I can see a case for everyone apologizing and agreeing Musk is doing a good job with Twitter in a year, although prediction markets [haven‚Äôt ](https://manifold.markets/ACXBot/29-will-twitters-average-monetizabl)[shifted](https://manifold.markets/Nostradamnedus/will-twitter-make-more-revenue-in-2) much since December.

**31:**[The Big Mac subsidy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PuCqfK9DcaZDHZbAx/big-mac-subsidy) \- one of my least favorite types of argument is when people argue something is bad because ‚Äúyou think it costs $1, but actually without government subsidies it would cost $100, you‚Äôre literally demanding that taxpayers subsidize your evil lifestyle‚Äù. And then you ask them for proof, and either they completely made it up, or by ‚Äúgovernment subsidy‚Äù they mean ‚Äúthe government doesn‚Äôt force the companies that make it to address all harms caused by its consumption, including harms no other company has to address, and harms I just made up right now, and harms from the fact that it makes me sad and I price my sadness at one billion dollars‚Äù. Anyway, the people who say that an unsubsidized Big Mac would cost $13 are definitely doing all of this.

**32:**[The Potato Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_paradox) (not really a paradox): ‚ÄúFred brings home 100 kg of potatoes, which (being purely mathematical potatoes) consist of 99% water (being purely mathematical water). He then leaves them outside overnight so that they consist of 98% water. What is their new weight? . . . The surprising answer is 50 kg.‚Äù
