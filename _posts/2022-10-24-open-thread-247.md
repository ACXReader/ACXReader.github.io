This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In other news:

 **1:** I’m wondering if the open threads would be more manageable if they happened more often, so for the next week or two I might test making the mid-week open thread available to everyone, not just subscribers. If I keep this, then I’ll figure out some other way to make it up to subscribers.

 **2:** A message from a team working on an impact market implementation:

> The [impactmarkets.io](http://impactmarkets.io/) team is developing version 2.0 of their platform. They are funded by the FTX Future Fund Regranting program, and have a limited budget to pay contractors. They are looking for developers that have experience with TypeScript and React (and ideally Next.js, Prisma, or tRPC) to contribute. It would be well-suited for devs that want to have a large EA-aligned impact in their free time. Pay is $0-50/hour, based on skill and volunteer interest. [Book a call](https://calendly.com/goodexchange/30min) with them or join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/DRnxtSCc8p) to learn more or apply.

 **3:** Comment of the week is KillerBee [explaining why he supports the California bill that restricts use of rap lyrics as criminal evidence](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/another-bay-area-house-party/comment/9828453). Also, Unsigned Integer gives [the best explanation I’ve ever heard](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/another-bay-area-house-party/comment/9853499) for why increases in the minimum wage might not decrease employment (it’s nominal wage rigidity).
