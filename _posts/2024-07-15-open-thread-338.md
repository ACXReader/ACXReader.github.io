This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** The European branch of our conspiracy is hosting a Community Weekend just outside Berlin, September 13-16, expected attendance ~250. [See here for more information ](https://www.lesswrong.com/events/tBYRFJNgvKWLeE9ih/less-wrong-community-weekend-2024)and [see here to apply](https://airtable.com/appdYMNuMQvKWC8mv/pagiUldderZqbuBaP/form), base price €250 but discounts available. 

**2:** Several people speculated that [the recent Don Juan review](/p/your-book-review-don-juan) was secretly by me. It wasn’t, but unrelatedly I _have_ been working on a Don-Juan-related project, which I might show you at some point. I’m mentioning this now so that I don’t seem like I’m plagiarizing the (excellent) review.

**3:** And many people also enjoyed the [Family That Couldn’t Sleep review](/p/your-book-review-the-family-that). If you want to know the latest on prions, and especially on chronic wasting disease of deer, I recommend this blog post by my friend EukaryoteWrites: [Will The Growing Deer Prion Epidemic Spread To Humans? Why Not?](https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2023/06/24/chronic-wasting-disease/)
