This is the trimonthly (?) classifieds thread. Advertise whatever you want in the comments.

To keep things organized, please respond to the appropriate top-level comment:**Employment, Dating, Read My Blog**(also includes podcasts, books, etc)**, Consume My Product/Service, Meetup,** or **Other.** I’ll delete anything that’s not in the appropriate category.

Remember that posting dating ads is hard and scary. Please refrain from commenting too negatively on anyone’s value as a human being. I’ll be much less strict about employers, bloggers, etc.
