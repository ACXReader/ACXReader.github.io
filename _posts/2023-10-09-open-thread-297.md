This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?).

 **EDIT:** Please think hard before commenting about recent events in the Middle East. They’re important and I’m not going to blanket-ban all discussion, but take a second before you hit “post” to think about how some readers here might have family members who are affected, and how everyone involved is a human being who’s experiencing these events in real life. I will have a hair trigger for deleting posts and permabanning commenters.
