This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** Nicholas C, who likes the book review contest, is trying to coordinate a general ACX community book rating system. You can use it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfP5TkFkDhhIw9Rw0NtJhP4a6kim280KVjY7z0TsSLwM9H-5g/viewform). I forgot to get permission to share his email address but hopefully he’ll show up in the comments and you can talk about it there.

**2:** In my [ivermectin post](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted?s=w), about a third of the way down, are two analyses of whether a raw meta-analysis makes it look like ivermectin works. I concluded that they showed marginal effect, but that this was probably due to other factors (eg antiparasitic properties). [A reader points out ](https://doyourownresearch.substack.com/p/scott-alexander-corrects-error-ivermectin?s=w)that it was wrong to do this by t-test, and I should have used a DerSimonian-Laird test because it’s a meta-analysis, which would have shown a clear (not marginal) effect, so I updated the post and my [Mistakes page](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/mistakes?s=w). More recently, [another reader has commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v3ljan/scott_alexander_corrects_error_ivermectin/ib7prr6/) that a DerSimonian-Laird test is _also_ inappropriate because the studies aren’t homogenous, and now I’m not sure _which_ test is appropriate or what result it would give - but it definitely wasn’t the one I originally tried. I don’t think this significantly alters the overall conclusion of the post, which was that the apparent effect (whether marginal or clear) was better explained by other things.

**3:** Michael Shellenberger, candidate for governor of California, objected to my characterization of his opinions in my [gubernatorial candidates post](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/california-gubernatorial-candidates?s=w):

[![Twitter avatar for @ShellenbergerMD](https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/ShellenbergerMD.jpg)Michael Shellenberger @ShellenbergerMD@slatestarcodex Thank you for correcting the error about my position about Suboxone, but you make another error claiming I support “sweeping institutionalization of the mentally ill.” That’s simply false. I address this issue at length in my book and writings. Please correct it.](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1531390892392689665)[9:43 PM ∙ May 30, 2022

I’ve provisionally corrected it and added an entry to my Mistakes page, and plan to read Shellenberger’s book to get a better sense of exactly what he does and doesn’t support. Sorry for the error.

**4:** Some highlights from the last Classifieds thread: [Anti-factory-farming charity seeking litigation attorney](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/classifieds-thread-62022/comment/6934326?s=w), [John Schilling needs spaceship tech support people](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/classifieds-thread-62022/comment/6917067?s=w), [Russian emigre looking for work/study in data science or AI alignment](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/classifieds-thread-62022/comment/6906697?s=w), [can a doctor help give marketing/distribution advice for underused COVID drug?](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/classifieds-thread-62022/comment/6898105?s=w)
