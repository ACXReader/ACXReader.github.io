This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Thanks to everyone who entered the Prediction Contest; entry is now closed. You can continue to make predictions on Manifold or Metaculus, but they won’t officially count. Also, another prediction market, [Futuur, has markets up for the contest questions](https://futuur.com/q/tag/astral-codex-ten-2023-prediction-contest). I’m pretty excited about this, because although Futuur does let you use play money like Manifold, it also offers real money betting (warning: requires crypto and a non-US IP). If you want to make real money bets on contest questions, now you can (and I’ll be seeing how they compare to the play money markets). 

**2:** In case you missed it: [Berkeley meetup this Tuesday](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/berkeley-meetup-on-tuesday-special), special guest Daniel Ingram.

**3:** Comment of the week: Meropenem [fills in more details about the Cadegiani case](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/response-to-alexandros-contra-me/comment/12405749) mentioned in my ivermectin article.

**4** : AI alignment org MIRI is trying to build a dataset for training AI systems. They need lots of examples of a very specific type of RPG-style story with careful explanations, and will pay $100 for good first attempts and maybe hire you to produce more. Please see <https://intelligence.org/visible/> for more.

**5:** ACX Grants update: You may remember Lars Doucet from his [guest posts](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty) on Georgism. Last year, he and Will Jarvis [received an ACX Grant](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results) to work on land value assessment technology that might make land value taxes more tractable and appealing. They’re happy to announce that this has turned into a startup, [ValueBase](https://www.valuebase.co/), which [raised $1.6 million in seed funding](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/valuebase-backed-by-sam-altmans-hydrazine-raises-1-6-million-seed-round/?guccounter=1). Congratulations to Lars, Will, and the ValueBase team for what I think is the second ACX Grants project to become a $1 million + company. 

**6:** Speaking of Lars - I tried to credit [Philosophy Bear](https://philosophybear.substack.com/) as someone who had beaten me to writing about the chatbot propaganda apocalypse, but I didn’t realize Lars had also discussed it on his blog - see [AI: Markets For Lemons, And The Great Logging Off](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/). I like his post because unlike Bear or my response to Bear, it’s not originally considering the problem through a political lens and so mostly just expects “spam, but worse” - which I think is broadly right, but didn’t emphasize enough earlier.

**7:** And you can bet on both [Lars’](https://manifold.markets/group/the-great-logging-off) and [my ](https://manifold.markets/TomShlomi)predictions about the chatbot propaganda apocalypse on Manifold. For example:
