This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

 **1:** Thanks to everyone who [volunteered to organize a local meetup](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/outdoor-careful-meetups-everywhere). You have about one more day to sign up if you haven’t already.

 **2:** Comment of the Week probably has to be [Richard Hanania’s response to my critique of his theory](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/contra-hanania-on-partisanship/comments#comment-2599663), though I’m not convinced for the reasons explored in the thread underneath.
