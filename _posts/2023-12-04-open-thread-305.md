This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

 **1:** Some good comments on [the monosemanticity post](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand), including dyoshida[ on simulation](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand/comment/44377629), johnny_lin’s attempt to [gamify explaining AI](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand/comment/44362465), theahura on [the analogy to polygenicity](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand/comment/44365962), sclmlw on [cell signaling pathways](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/god-help-us-lets-try-to-understand/comment/44377939), bestgreatestsuper [on manifolds](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/185dro1/god_help_us_lets_try_to_understand_ai/kb1wem1/). And Benji York links a post on [11-dimensional abstract structures in the human brain](https://blog.physics-astronomy.com/2022/12/the-human-brain-builds-structures-in-11.html). Many of these seem to be getting at the same idea where there are evolved systems scientists have so far failed to really understand - AIs, the genome, cellular signaling pathways - and maybe the same idea of a polysemantic → monosemantic reduction will help with all of them. I would love to see a longer treatment of this by someone who knows what they’re talking about.

 **2:** In [my defense of EA](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-effective), I said of its failures (primarily SBF) that “I’m not sure they cancel out the effect of saving _one_ life, let alone 200,000”. A friend convinced me that this was an unfair exaggeration. There are [purported exchange rates between money and lives](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation), destroying billions in value is pretty bad by all of them, and there are knock-on effects on social trust from fraud that suggest its negative effects should be valued even higher. I regret this sentence, no longer stand by it, and have added it to my Mistakes page.

 **3:** Related: I’m a big fan of the philosophical principles behind EA. I’m also mostly a big fan of the community, in the sense that it includes some of the best people I know - but I only know some parts of it, it’s also included bad actors, and friends have reminded me to remind you not to suspend normal healthy skepticism just because someone’s in a community with a good philosophy.

 **4:** Pseudonymous accelerationist leader “Beff Jezos”[ was doxxed by ](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1730788753567048104)_[Forbes](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1730788753567048104)_. I disagree with Jezos on the issues, but want to reiterate that doxxing isn’t acceptable. I don’t have a great way to fight back, but in sympathy I’ve blocked the journalist responsible (Emily Baker-White) on X, will avoid linking _Forbes_ on this blog for at least a year, and will never give an interview to any _Forbes_ journalist - if you think of other things I can do, let me know. Apologists said my doxxing was okay because I’d revealed my real name elsewhere so I was “asking for it”; they caught Jezos by applying voice recognition software to his podcast appearances, so I hope even those people agree that the Jezos case crossed a line.

Also, I complain a lot about the accelerationists’ failure to present real arguments or respond to critiques, but this is a good time to remember they’re still doing better than the media and its allies:
