Also:

**1:** ACX Grants update: 1DaySooner is surveying people who have been involved in conducting phase III clinical trials (eg doctor, nurse, statistician, recruitment coordinator) to get their opinion on human challenge trials.

**2:** I published the first Book Review contest finalist, [Cities And The Wealth Of Nations / The Question Of Separatism](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-cities-and-the-wealth), last week, and I’m happy with both the review and the interesting comments it sparked off.
