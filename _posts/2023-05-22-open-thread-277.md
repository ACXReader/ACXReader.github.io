This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** ACX Grants update: 1DaySooner is surveying people who have been involved in conducting phase III clinical trials (eg doctor, nurse, statistician, recruitment coordinator) to get their opinion on human challenge trials. If you're in this category and willing to help, go to [hctexpertopinion.com](https://www.hctexpertopinion.com/)

**2:** I published the first Book Review contest finalist, [Cities And The Wealth Of Nations / The Question Of Separatism](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-cities-and-the-wealth), last week, and Iâ€™m happy with both the review and the interesting comments it sparked off.
