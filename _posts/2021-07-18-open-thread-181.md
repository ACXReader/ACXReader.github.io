This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** Thanks to everyone who participated in the Reader Survey - and if you didn’t, [check it out here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-take-the-reader-survey). One correction - several people couldn’t access survey 21, the one on optical illusions. This was my fault. It should be fixed now, so if you were affected, you can [take it here](https://jatos.mindprobe.eu/publix/1521/start?batchId=1702&generalMultiple). Warning: it is very long.

**2:** Some good comments on the most recent prediction market post (also some less good ones - before you hit “post”, see if you’ve accidentally proven the stock market can’t exist). See eg Shaked [running some of the numbers](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/use-prediction-markets-to-fund-investigative/comments#comment-2367586) and finding it might work for a few very important people/issues, but maybe not for smaller things. Also, apparently Byrne Hobart had a similar (though less crazy) idea [two years ago](https://byrnehobart.medium.com/an-open-ipo-window-will-save-investigative-journalism-1c09947c24b6); I regret unintentionally copying him without credit.  
  
**3:** “Comment” (or whatever) of the week is this post from the subreddit: [I Believe We May Be At Another Point Like March 2020 With COVID](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ol673r/i_believe_we_may_be_at_another_point_like_march/). I haven’t looked into this as much as I want to, but the little I know about Delta is really concerning. 

**4:** Future Perfect - Vox’s journalism team covering effective altruism, existential risk, and related topics - is hiring (for remote work). You would get to work with my friend and housemate Kelsey Piper, along with a bunch of other people who I am assured are also great.
