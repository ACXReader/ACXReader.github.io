**Why:** Because we’re having [spring meetups in 70 cities](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/spring-meetups-in-seventy-cities?s=w), and Berkeley is one of them. I’m signal-boosting this one because I’ll be able to attend.

**When:** Saturday, May 7, 1:00 PM.

**Where:** UC Berkeley, [the lawn](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B052'20.2%22N+122%C2%B015'46.5%22W/@37.8722716,-122.2634668,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x978d110947c97732!8m2!3d37.8722705!4d-122.2629196) just east of West Circle and north of Free Speech Bikeway. 

**Who:** Anyone who wants. Please feel free to come even if you feel awkward about it, even if you’re not “the typical ACX reader”, even if you’re worried people won’t like you, etc.

I’ll check the comments to this post in case there are any questions.
