This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. You can also talk at the unofficial ACX community [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), or [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php). Also:

**1:** Philip Tetlock (of _Superforecasting_ fame) and his team are running a new tournament that combines forecasting and persuasion. They want people who are familiar with x-risk and willing to spend ~3 hours a week for a few months thinking/talking about it. People selected to participate will get $2,000 to $10,000 (and some people can win $2,000 as a prize just for applying). [See here for more information and to apply](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NLDoILtL_jK0X1nLDkWoqAnfAdxOfBvRKxSNU4EpjU/edit).
