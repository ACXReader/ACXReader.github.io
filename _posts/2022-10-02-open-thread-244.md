This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** I’m trying to collect information on how last year’s ACX Grants winners are doing. I should have emailed everyone involved a form, but I know that the emails to Michael Sklar and 1DaySooner bounced, and based on how few responses I’ve gotten I worry some others have as well. If this is you, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/hQWuC157TCTgLiQe6) by October 15. If you didn’t get an ACX Grant last year, no need to worry about this.

**2:** The Motte, a culture and politics subreddit which is a descendant of the old SSC Subreddit Culture War Thread, has moved off Reddit because of censorship worries. It’s now at [themotte.org](https://www.themotte.org/). You always worry about losing users during a move, but I see their main weekly thread is at 1766 comments and counting, so it looks like it’s going all right! They say:

> This website is a place for people who want to move past shady thinking and test their ideas in a court of people who don't all share the same biases. Our goal is to optimize for light, not heat; this is a group effort, and all commentators are asked to do their part.

**3:** Matt G, who comments here as “Vaniver”, invited me and some friends over to try the stew mentioned in [Universe Hopping Through Substack](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/universe-hopping-through-substack). I can report that it was okay. Thank you Vaniver for your commitment to empiricism!

**4:** Comments of the week: Resident Contrarian [corrects/clarifies](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/universe-hopping-through-substack/comment/9370105) the way some Christians use the term “inspired”, and Shaked on [“stair vs. elevator” predictions](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/from-nostradamus-to-fukuyama/comment/9347441).

**5:** Based on recent events, I’m going to bring back the thing where the bottom comment on the open thread is a place for Russian and Ukrainian readers who need help eg fleeing their countries to coordinate with Westerners and each other. I hope you are all okay, please let me know if there’s any way to help.
