All finalists win a permanent free subscription to Astral Codex Ten - since a subscription costs $10/month, this is technically an infinity dollar value! If you already have a subscription, you are now a Super Double Mega-Subscriber, which has no consequences in the material world, but several important metaphysical advantages. I should have already credited this to your email addresses; please let me know if it didn't go through or if I used the wrong address.

People who won the top prizes also get monetary awards. Due to the generosity of subscribers to this blog, I've decided to quintuple the amounts I originally promised - so first place will get $5000, second place $2500, and third place $1250. Readers' Choice will also get $1250. If you won a monetary prize, please email me at scott@slatestarcodex.com with either a Paypal account, an Ethereum address, or a charity you want me to donate to.

Finally, if you're curious who wrote which runners-up reviews, you can find a list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vgXd-H7Fk6I7qAG7Dwh6VZn8dYIhV0dQHsI_owPSIIg/edit#gid=0). I’ve tried to include full names only for people who explicitly told me to do that, first name plus last initial to people who gave me their full names but didn't give explicit permission, and pseudonyms for everyone else. I've also included personal websites and blogs for everyone who asked or heavily implied that I should list them. If I made an important error in how I listed your name, please email me at scott@slatestarcodex.com
