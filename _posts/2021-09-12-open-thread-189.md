This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

 **1:** I’m away this month visiting meetups, so expect posts here to be slightly lighter and further apart, sorry. Next on my schedule is Lisbon (Saturday 9/18 at 5) and Madrid (very tentatively 9/25 at 11), I’ll continue to provide updates. And check [the master spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSMKpBkT5y4yOIcUYqKGzuyZ7jdZTKSrp-bASqY6Y5VV0ta6_hNwVWWMI2wQDzj21TaA4lMS-KSio/pubhtml), where new meetups are still coming in (most recently Cebu in the Philippines).

 **2:** Effective altruist organization Open Phil is offering scholarships to interested-in-effective-altruism international undergrads applying to top US and UK universities. See [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/other-areas/undergraduate-scholarship) for more information.
