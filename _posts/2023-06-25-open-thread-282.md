This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Comment of the week: themausch [expands on binary junior/senior distinctions in the programmer job market](https://substack.com/profile/1243656-themausch/note/c-17070012?utm_source=activity_item).

**2:** Also, Woolyai analyzes the “have you cut off family members/been cut off over politics” question from the ACX survey: [Who Cancels And Who Gets Cancelled](https://woolyai.substack.com/p/who-cancels-and-who-gets-canceled)? I don’t love the title, since I think cutting off family members is a noncentral example of “cancellation”. But I do love the data analysis, which is good and thorough.

**3:** Correction on [the review of ](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-programming-and-metaprogramming)_[Programming And Metaprogramming The Human Biocomputer](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-programming-and-metaprogramming)_ (subscriber only post): I wrote that the game Ecco The Dolphin was based on John Lilly’s bizarre theory of coincidences. Commenter [Angela](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-programming-and-metaprogramming/comment/17650570) gave strong evidence that this is false - see [here ](https://twitter.com/edannunziata/status/1261080050910150657)and also [here](https://twitter.com/edannunziata/status/250307896573820928), by the game designer - and all the resemblances are, uh, coincidental.

**4:** Lightcone is a team that operates important AI alignment and rationalist community infrastructure, including the Less Wrong website, the Alignment Forum, and the Rose Garden Inn (a venue for various alignment-related conferences and projects - also where we have Berkeley ACX meetups!) They're running low on money due to Rose Garden renovations being unexpectedly expensive and grants being unexpectedly thin, and are asking for a few 6+ figure grants to help tide them through this difficult period. If you're a wealthy person or grantmaker interested in AI alignment, [see here for more information](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9iDw6ugMPk7pmXuyW/lightcone-infrastructure-lesswrong-is-looking-for-funding), or contact me at scott@slatestarcodex.com if you have questions, or get in touch with the head of Lightcone directly at habryka@lesswrong.com.
