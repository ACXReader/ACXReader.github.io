This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

**1:** Corrections from [Monday’s Model Cities post](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/model-city-monday-12621) \- Praxis only received about $4 million in funding, and not directly from Thiel. I regret the error and am trying to get more information on their perspective. Also, since I last wrote about the Honduran political situation, the vote projections have changed, and the right-wingers will probably have at least 1/3 of Congress votes, preventing their opponents from getting the 2/3 majority they would need to legislatively oppose ZEDEs. I’ll have more about this next time I write about model cities.

**2:** Thanks again to Lars for his recent Georgism posts. He wants me to add that [he found the Hagman citation he was looking for](https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1469541646954115073), and it is “a giant anti-Georgist diatribe written as an authorial self-insert fan fiction, IN SPACE, confidently expounding upon how an LVT experiment failed on the planet Mars”.

**3:** And several readers commented that they had been “georgepilled” - they ought to know that the historically accurate term is [“seen the cat”](https://www.henrygeorge.org/catsup.htm). Somebody [even made](https://www.reddit.com/r/georgism/comments/gi8var/geodsden_flag/) a mock Gadsen flag about it:
