This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** I’m still planning to come to [the NYC meetup at 3 today](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/new-york-meetup-on-sunday), looking forward to seeing some of you there.

**2:** M, you have tried to email me a few times over the past few years about publishing _Unsong_ , and I have tried to email you back, but something has gone wrong and we haven’t connected - maybe one of us accidentally blocks the other’s response emails. If you are reading this, please send me some non-email contact method like a phone number and I’ll try to get in touch.
