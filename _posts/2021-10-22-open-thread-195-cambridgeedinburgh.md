This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** Cambridge meetup this Saturday, October 23, 1 PM, at [proper.event.wiring](https://w3w.co/proper.event.wiring), aka near the Jesus Green Skatepark.

**2:** Edinburgh**** meetup this Sunday, October 24, 5 PM, at LAST SECOND CHANGE it's now at Le Monde on George Street sorry everyone.

3: Comment of the week is [nickiter](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/chilling-effects/comment/3302338), [Kevin Jackson](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/chilling-effects/comment/3297306), and everyone else who pointed out that people can die of hypothermia at surprisingly high temperatures - and I guess I have no evidence that temperature effects on heart attacks can’t start at surprisingly high temperatures either. I’ve updated to believe that a lot of the sub-Saharan African hypothermia deaths may in fact be cold-related and not flu.
