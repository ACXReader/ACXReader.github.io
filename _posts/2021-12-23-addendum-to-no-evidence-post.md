The day after I wrote [The Phrase “No Evidence” Is A Red Flag For Bad Science Communication](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-phrase-no-evidence-is-a-red-flag), FT published [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/020534b3-5a54-4517-9fd1-167a5db50786):

Like many uses of “no evidence”, they meant that one particular study of this complicated question had failed to reject the null hypothesis.

Here’s what happened to [Metaculus’ prediction tournament](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8766/omicron-variant-less-deadly-than-delta/) when the same study came out:

The consensus prediction dropped from 72% chance that it was less lethal, to 63% chance. But it quickly recovered, and is now up to 80%.

This is an unusually clear example of the difference between classical and Bayesian ways of thinking.
