This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** More salvos in AI scaling conversation: Jacob Buckman on [naive scaling](https://jacobbuckman.com/2022-06-14-an-actually-good-argument-against-naive-ai-scaling/) and on [failure cases](https://jacobbuckman.com/2022-06-15-the-one-where-i-rebut-gary-marcus/).

**2:** Thanks to everyone who said hi to me at Solstice yesterday. And sorry if I was a little too argumentative sometimes - I’m trying to get better!
