 **1:** More salvos in AI scaling conversation: Jacob Buckman on [naive scaling](https://jacobbuckman.com/2022-06-14-an-actually-good-argument-against-naive-ai-scaling/) and on [failure cases](https://jacobbuckman.com/2022-06-15-the-one-where-i-rebut-gary-marcus/).

 **2:** Thanks to everyone who said hi to me at Solstice yesterday. And sorry if I was a little too argumentative sometimes - I’m trying to get better!
