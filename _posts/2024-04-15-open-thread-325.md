This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** More meetups this week, including London, Oxford, SF, Cambridge (UK), Vienna, Portland, Jerusalem, Sydney, Ann Arbor, Capetown, Paris, Rome, Lisbon, Boulder, Dallas, **Leipzig** , and **Jakarta** ; bolding these last two since they were later additions you might have missed the first time. Check [the list](/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2024) for more information. 

**2:** Thanks to everyone for continued good discussion on the [Highlights From The Comments On The Lab Leak Debate](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7). I want to avoid getting bogged down in this forever, so I’ll mostly try to resist responding and just highlight some of the pro-lab-leak comments I found most thought-provoking:

  * ACX commenter David Bahry has [published a paper on the lab leak case](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00313-23), especially relating to ascertainment bias.

  * Bahry was also able to find [the source of the George Gao quote](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53563090) (though see also objection [here](https://twitter.com/flodebarre/status/1695484121789673942))

  * Saar [on the negative blood samples](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53592553).

  * Simon Stats [on early COVID doubling time arguments](https://arguablywrong.home.blog/2024/04/09/how-likely-is-it-for-covid-to-establish-itself/) (but cf my response [here](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53962488))

  * A figure I took from Peter’s blog post [was edited from its original context](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53608334), further explanation [here](https://twitter.com/tgof137/status/1778080286934233370).

  * Michael Weissman’s [probabilities](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53645411).

  * [Long discussion of new data about DEFUSE proposal](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53646726).




Feel free to discuss your thoughts on these here, I won’t be participating. Also: [Phil H explains why one of the scientists in this debate is named “Lv”](/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-the-5d7/comment/53522537) (it’s a romanization issue)

**3:** Sorry for low post volume recently, combination of kids, illness, and trying to get all the lab leak stuff tied up. Hopefully will improve ~~in 18 years~~ shortly.
