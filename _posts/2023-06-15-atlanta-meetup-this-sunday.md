I’m visiting family in Atlanta this week and should have time to make the local ACX meetup. 

**When:** Sunday, June 18th @ 3:00 PM

**Where:** Bold Monk Brewing, 1737 Ellsworth Industrial Blvd NW, Suite D-1,  
Atlanta, GA. 

The organizers say “We will be outside out front – this is subject to change, but we will be somewhere in Bold Monk. If you do not see us in the front please check upstairs or out back – look for the yellow table sign.”

**Who:** Everyone is welcome, even if they’re new, disagree with the blog, “not the typical reader”, etc. The organizers ask that you RSVP at [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/acx-atlanta/events/293918319/) or on [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/events/MZBC6dv6ky5igSm5L/the-june-2023-acx-atlanta-will-feature-scott-alexander).

There’s a slight chance I’ll have to cancel last minute due to family health issues, in which case I’ll try to let you know on or before Sunday’s Open Thread. If I cancel, I assume everyone else will still be there.
