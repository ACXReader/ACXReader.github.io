This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also: 

1: Comment of the week: [more from an expert in the field](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-terrible-world-of#comment-1970985) on the future of digital therapeutics and why their price tag is so high.

2: And from the discussion of _Accidental Superpower:_ China [moves from being low-cost to high-expertise](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-accidental-superpower#comment-2024902); [Russia strong](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-accidental-superpower#comment-2028044).
