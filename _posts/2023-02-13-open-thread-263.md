This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

 **1:** Philosophy Bear, who wrote the original piece on the chatbot apocalypse, [responds to my response](https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/chatbotocyplase-2-the-botten-ing).

 **2:** Correction from last week’s links: Steve Kirsch did _not_ in fact back out of his bet with Saar Wilf; although they briefly reached an impasse, they’ve solved it and plan to [go forward with the debate](https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/saar-wilf-founder-of-rootclaim-has). I’m not sure if this is a good truth-finding method, but I’m intrigued by it and will probably cover it when it happens.

 **3:** Comments of the week: [Maximum Limelihood Estimator explains](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/crowds-are-wise-and-ones-a-crowd/comment/12566031) why we should expect the error on Wisdom of Crowds task to be the inverse square root. And [demost beat me to](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-survey-results-2022/comment/12089011) analyzing the Wisdom of Crowds survey results.

 **4:** Someone recently contacted me saying there was a potential emergency involving an Internet friend of theirs, and asked if I could help them get in touch. As the admin of SSC, I’m able to see the email addresses attached to people’s comments, even if they’re not public. After thinking a bit about my responsibilities, I told him his friend’s nonpublic email (which didn’t include their real name). I’m not sure what I would do in a similar situation where it did. If you have any (ethical, not legal) advice for me, please let me know.
