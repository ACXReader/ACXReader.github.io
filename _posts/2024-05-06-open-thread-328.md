This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** More meetups this week in Helsinki, Waterloo, Sao Paulo, Raleigh-Durham, Tokyo, Copenhagen, Munich, Oslo, Barcelona, Montreal, Ottawa, Singapore, San Antonio, Denver, Warsaw. See [the meetups post](/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2024) for more info. And note addition of Kaduna, Nigeria.

**2:**[Robin Hanson](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/second-response-to-alexander-on-medicine) and [Richard Hanania](https://twitter.com/RichardHanania/status/1785756978670862735) have both responded to my posts on their work; I’ll probably have Highlights From The Comments threads where I discuss their responses further at some point.

**3:** Jason Crawford is sponsoring another [progress studies blog-building fellowship](https://fellowship.rootsofprogress.org/programs/?utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t6j2eKlHg5QRLYXW2wRNavQFPDMohPcyBGsamT-pyLIjp51tDnD0VyiHX9Z-9hIdrvW_fwQtnAwo4B-SZOvN6EoUbLA&_hsmi=305040193&utm_content=305040193&utm_source=hs_email), with advisors including Tyler Cowen and Andrej Karpathy. 

**4:** I’ve gone through comment moderation backlog and banned seven more people. Remember, if someone makes a very bad comment, you can click the “. . .“ to the right of the comment and select Report from the drop-down menu. The wheels of justice may turn slowly (I check the moderation queue once every few months), but they grind exceeding small.
