This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** Solenoid_Entity, who runs the [ACX Podcast](https://linktr.ee/sscpodcast), is expanding his empire to run a [Less Wrong Curated Podcast](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kDjKF2yFhFEWe4hgC/announcing-the-lesswrong-curated-podcast) and [Metaculus Journal Podcast](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11102/introducing-the-metaculus-journal-podcast/). Good luck, Solenoid!

**2:** More volleys in recent AI conversations: [Cameron Bucker](https://twitter.com/cameronjbuckner/status/1536265110787866624) (“debates in deep learning are now repeating the same mistakes as comparative psychology”), [Edwin Chen](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/humans-vs-gary-marcus) (how do humans do on the same questions Gary Marcus asked GPT?), and a new paper, [Emergent Abilities Of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682) (formalizing the insight that as models scale up, they can do completely new types of tasks, not just the old tasks better).

**3:** Related: does anyone reading this have access to the new [Parti-20B image model](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1539821642775678976) from Google? I would like to check whether I have won [my bet with Vitor](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-guide-to-asking-robots-to-design/comment/6945486?s=r) about image model progress. If yes, I will write a post about it and give you good publicity. Please contact me at scott[at]slatestarcodex[dot]com

**4:** In Obscure Pregnancy Interventions, I mentioned a Mongolian study found that air purifier use during pregnancy increased birth rate, but that nobody had tested yet whether it increased later-life IQ. Those results are now in and [it appears that it does](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/956654). Caveats (some from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/viscah/reducing_air_pollution_can_support_healthy_brain/)) only marginally significant, your area is probably less air polluted than Mongolia, normal air conditioners might work as air purifiers already. Update: Emil K [says it seems p-hacked](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-230/comment/7377328).
