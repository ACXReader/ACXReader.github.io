This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Happy New Year!

**2:** I’m too swamped to run my own forecasting tournament this year, so Metaculus is taking over. If you want to participate, [check this link](https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/ACX2024/?has_group=false&project=2844&order_by=-activity). I will be grading last year’s tournament and posting results hopefully sometime this month.
