Many cities have regular Astral Codex Ten meetup groups. Twice a year, I try to advertise their upcoming meetups and make a bigger deal of it than usual so that irregular attendees can attend. This is one of those times.

This year we have spring meetups planned in over eighty cities, from Tokyo, Japan to Seminyak, Indonesia. Thanks to all the organizers who responded to my request for details, and to Meetups Czar Skyler and the Less Wrong team for making this happen.

You can find the list below, in the following order:

  1. Africa & Middle East

  2. Asia-Pacific (including Australia)

  3. Europe (including UK)

  4. North America & Central America

  5. South America




There should very shortly be a map of these meetups on[ the LessWrong community page](https://www.lesswrong.com/community).

Within each region it’s alphabetized first by country then by city - so the first entry in Europe is Vienna, **A** ustria. The exception is the USA, where they’re also alphabetized by state - so the first entry in the USA is Phoenix, **A** rizona. 

I’ll provisionally be attending the Berkeley meetup on June 5th. Skyler will provisionally be attending Northampton, Manhattan, Boston, Brooklyn, Baltimore, Burlington, and Berkeley.

**Extra Info For Potential Attendees**

**1.** If you’re reading this, you’re invited. Please don’t feel like you “won’t be welcome” just because you’re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You’ll be fine!  
**2**. You don’t have to RSVP or contact the organizer to be able to attend (unless the event description says otherwise); RSVPs are mostly to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up, and let them tell you if there are last-second changes. I’ve also given email addresses or other contact information for organizers in case you have a question.

**Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:  
  
1.** If you’re the host, bring a sign that says “ACX MEETUP” and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).  
**2.** Bring blank labels and markers for nametags.  
**3.** Have people type their name and email address in a spreadsheet or in a Google Form (accessed via a bit.ly link or QR code), so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.  
**4.** If it’s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and if you try to organize some kind of “fun” “event” it’ll probably just be annoying.  
**5.** It’s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you’re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.  
**6.** In case people want to get to know each other better outside the meetup, you might want to mention[ reciprocity.io](https://www.reciprocity.io/), the rationalist friend-finder/dating site.  
**7.** If you didn’t make a LessWrong event for your meetup, the LessWrong team did it for you using the email address you gave here. To claim your event, log into LW (or create an account) using that email address, or message the LW team on Intercom (chat button in the bottom right corner of lesswrong.com).

If you need to change a meetup date or you have any other questions, please email skyler[at]rationalitymeetups[dot]org.

Event Link: <https://www.lesswrong.com/events/j7xvKMy96W6Lcy77j/newton-acx-meetups-everywhere-spring-2024>  
Additional Notes: Mostly unstructured talking. Anywhere along the Upper Falls Greenway (between Easy St and the Charles River, paralleling Needham St) works, since I expect we'll be walking to and fro. However, newbies should show up **at the Easy St end** so we don't get lost. If there's demand for it we can also migrate to the footpath on the Needham side of the river as well (between Highland Ave and 2nd Ave). I plan on bringing my plush duck. I may or may not bring nametags. If I don't bring nametags, I'll ask everyone to introduce their names (internet names are ok for this meetup). Other types of people beyond rationalists (eg postrats, alignment researchers, predictors, EAs, etc.) are welcome!

There are disabled spaces directly in front of the Common House (100 Black Birch Trail). If we overflow the road, people can use the resident lots to the left and right.
