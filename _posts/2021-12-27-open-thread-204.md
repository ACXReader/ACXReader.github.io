**1:** Sorry, I know I said I would have the Grants results up by Christmas, but Iâ€™m waiting for the last few funder checks to clear, plus I realized if I posted something on Christmas nobody would read it. Current prediction is sometime this week, probably Tuesday.

 **2:** Comments of the week: John Schilling [walks us through](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-203/comment/4085611) his Omicron math in more detail; Chaostician on the [history of](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-203/comment/4085179) using mummies to cure disease.
