This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

 **1:** Reminder that we are still [looking for organizers for this year’s Meetups Everywhere](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/meetups-everywhere-2022-call-for), ie volunteer to host an ACX meetup in your city that will get signal-boosted on the blog. We seem to have had unusually few people apply this time around, so if you were on the fence, please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehzo1uJvafl9SNYn0USxafV_MtrwhDJ96cHLx5-QQiXI_djQ/viewform).
