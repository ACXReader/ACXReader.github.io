**1:** I finally went through the past three months of reported comments and banned people who needed banning. New bans for [Brett S](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-justice/comment/7665856), [Karl](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-low-hanging-fruit-argument-models/comment/5891372), [Sleazy E](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/mantic-monday-41822/comment/6125375), [JSTR](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/which-party-has-gotten-more-extreme/comment/7005611) (3 months), [Adept](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-future-of-fusion/comment/7204453), Cal Lawson, [Charles Casaburi](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/what-caused-the-2020-homicide-spike/comment/7487779), [Arian Bagheri Pour Fallah](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-226/comment/6849993), [HumbleRando](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-castrato/comment/7666088), [Deiseach](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/hidden-open-thread-2315/comment/7644054) (1 month), and [NavyBlueSmoke](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-outlier/comment/7637222). New major warnings (halfway to ban) for [JDK](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/dictator-book-club-xi-jinping/comment/5928200), [истинец](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/obscure-pregnancy-interventions-much/comment/7665901), [Roger Biles](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-april-644/comment/6486256), [Ludex](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/in-partial-grudging-defense-of-the/comment/6776449), [Trebuchet](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-226/comment/6907511), and [Golden_Feather](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-outlier/comment/7666141). New minor warning for [Beowulf888](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-dawn-of-everything/comment/7666119).

**2:** Please don’t comment “First!” in a comment thread, make a joke about how you were going to do it but won’t (if that joke is the entire comment), or make related jokes (ie commenting “Second!”). If you do this I will warn or ban you.

**3:** I might or might not get around to writing a Highlights From The Comments On Criticism Of Criticism Of Criticism, but I at least want to point to [this comment by Remmett](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/criticism-of-criticism-of-criticism/comment/7855380), author of the criticism post I pointed to as too vague, where he explains more about what he was trying to do and how I got it wrong.

**4:** More EA jobs: Open Philanthropy Project [wants a Grants Associate](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openphilanthropy/243da982-26bb-4412-8d48-71d6da45ea92) to help process and organize grants relating to long-termism (eg AI, xrisk, forecasting, etc).
