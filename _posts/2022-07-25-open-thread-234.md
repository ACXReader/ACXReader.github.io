 **2:** Please don’t comment “First!” in a comment thread, make a joke about how you were going to do it but won’t (if that joke is the entire comment), or make related jokes (ie commenting “Second!”). If you do this I will warn or ban you.

 **3:** I might or might not get around to writing a Highlights From The Comments On Criticism Of Criticism Of Criticism, but I at least want to point to [this comment by Remmett](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/criticism-of-criticism-of-criticism/comment/7855380), author of the criticism post I pointed to as too vague, where he explains more about what he was trying to do and how I got it wrong.

 **4:** More EA jobs: Open Philanthropy Project [wants a Grants Associate](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openphilanthropy/243da982-26bb-4412-8d48-71d6da45ea92) to help process and organize grants relating to long-termism (eg AI, xrisk, forecasting, etc).
