This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Far Out Initiative ([described here](/p/profile-the-far-out-initiative)) is looking for help from people with backgrounds in bioinformatics and applying AI/ML to genetics. If that's you, reach out at contact@faroutinitiative.com.

**2:** Comment of the week: an r/ssc reader with a (thankfully minor) spine injury [shares his extensive thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1eicznz/your_book_review_two_arms_and_a_head/lg6n6ov/) on the recent Two Arms And A Leg review. Iâ€™ll try to collect the Nietzsche comments into a Highlights post soon.
