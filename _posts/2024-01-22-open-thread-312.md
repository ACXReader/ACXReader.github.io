This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

 **1:** Corrections on [links](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/links-for-january-2024): the pro-Palestine slogan “from the river to the sea” was banned [only in Berlin](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1699528989-berlin-criminalizes-slogan-from-the-river-to-the-sea-palestine-will-be-free), not all of Germany, and has since been [unbanned](https://www.newarab.com/news/germany-two-courts-say-pro-palestinian-slogans-legal). And our resident Genealogian [critiques the claimed line of descent from Odin to Joe Biden](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/links-for-january-2024/comment/47547032).

 **2:** Nils K, who got an ACX Grant for his study on Bayesian updating and precision weighting, writes: 

> I'm seeking collaborators who have access to a psychology lab and would be willing to help with the data collection for the study. Necessary resources include a student pool, a lab with a decent PC, and somebody willing to do the actual testing. Collaborators should be willing to test at least ten participants, with 8-12 hours of testing time each. Contributors can be credited as co-authors in the paper. If interested, please reach out to [n.kraus@phb.de](mailto:n.kraus@phb.de).
