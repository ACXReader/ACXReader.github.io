_To the tune of:_

**CHORUS OF EPIDEMIOLOGISTS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
Show mercy if you can  
Lock down, lock down  
To save your fellow man

**CITIZEN ONE:**  
The spring is here  
The sun is in the sky

**CHORUS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
Or thousands more will die

**CITIZEN TWO:**  
I've done no wrong  
I want to cut my hair

**CHORUS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
The virus doesn't care

**CITIZEN THREE:**  
A single hug  
One hug is all I ask

**CHORUS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
Six feet and wear a mask

**CITIZEN FOUR:**  
When I get free, you won't see me  
Here for dust

**CHORUS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
We're sorry, that's the rule

**CITIZEN FIVE:**  
How long, O Lord  
Before my kids have school?

**CHORUS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
Show mercy if you can  
Lock down, lock down  
To save your fellow man

**NURSE:**  
Now bring me patient number twenty-three  
You will be getting your vaccine from me  
You know what that means

**ME:**  
Yes, it means I'm free!

**NURSE:**  
No!  
[Large gatherings could still transmit](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)  
You're still at risk

**ME:**  
I'm thirty-six and fit!

**NURSE:**  
You're in the herd

**ME:**  
I barely leave my room  
My social life is close to death  
And I've been stuck here -

**NURSE:**  
\- You'll be stuck again  
Unless you learn to value expertise

**ME:**  
I know the value of these thirteen months  
Because of expertise

**NURSE:**  
[Two days to find the key](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11)  
[The rest](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/46/28538), [because bureaucracy](https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/04/how-key-decisions-slowed-fdas-review-of-covid-19-vaccine-but-also-gave-it-important-data/)  
Yes, patient twenty-three

**ME:**  
Time’s up, I’m gonna go

**NURSE:**  
And here's your passport  
Do not forget your card  
Do not forget it  
Patient twenty-three

**CHORUS:**  
Lock down, lock down  
New variants are near  
Lock down, lock down  
You'll always live in fear

**ME:**  
Freedom is mine. The earth is still.  
I feel the wind. I breathe again.  
And the sky clears  
The world is waking.  
Drink from the pool. How clean the taste.  
Never forget the year of waste.  
Nor forgive the FDA  
For what they've done.  
They are the guilty - every one.  
The day begins  
And now let's see  
What this new world  
Will do for me.
