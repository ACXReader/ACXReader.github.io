This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

In case you missed it last week, I’m [accepting grant applications](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/apply-for-an-acx-grant). So far many people have generously volunteered to help fund grants, and relatively few people have submitted really high-quality ideas I’m excited about. So no need to volunteer more funding, but if you have great ideas please send in an [application form](https://forms.gle/UG34SZJDbZiRudTV8).

So far I’ve got about 100 applications. Types of grant proposals I need less of on the margin:

  * Social media sites

  * Education and science communication projects (these are great, we’re just kind of heavy on them right now)

  * Attempts to develop new ways to think about psychology

  * Things on blockchains, although if your idea is actually good (eg <https://www.gwern.net/CO2-Coin>) this doesn’t have to be a dealbreaker

  * Lifestyle products that would make people feel self-actualized

  * Cool startup ideas of unclear charitable relevance

  * Perpetual motion machines (yes, really)

  * People who say they want to leverage new ways of thinking to create coordinated high-impact outcomes or whatever, without explaining _what specific things they are going to do._

  * Things that will help advance cutting-edge AI research. Remember, I think AI might be bad, and I hope it comes as late as possible so we have more time to prepare. If you have proposals to _hinder_ the advance of cutting-edge AI research, send them to me! Or if you have proposals to help AI _safety_ research, send those too (people who are just looking into normal AI applications for health care or whatever don’t have to worry about this).

  * People saying “I don’t need money, I just want your official stamp of approval so I can use it to convince other people”. I have already committed to throwing money at things, including unlikely-to-work-but-could-be-cool things. But if I have to _stake my reputation_ _on it_ then I’ll be looking it over with a fine-toothed comb and being super-conservative.




Types of grant proposals I need more of on the margin:

  * Basic research into important scientific questions

  * Biomedical research

  * Well-thought-out proposals to enact political change

  * Field-building

  * Forecasting

  * Anything that might lead to 20,000 clones of John von Neumann

  * High-impact, concrete proposals to help the global poor




The questions I most often had after reading people’s applications were “why would this be good?”, “why isn’t this a for-profit startup?”, “but what _actual, concrete_ things are you going to _do?”,_ and _“_ if you care so much about this and you’re a software engineer at Google and it only costs $1000 why haven’t you just funded it yourself?” If your applications answer those questions, you’ll have a better chance of getting accepted, or at least of saving yourself an email conversation with me about them.
