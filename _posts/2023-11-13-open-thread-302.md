 **1:** Comment of the week is Seth Schoen’s description of [a Wikipedia fight over the book ](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/comment/43253327)_[A Void](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/comment/43253327)_ \- the book is famous for not using the letter “e”, and the Wikipedians argued about whether it was appropriate for its article to operate under the same constraint.
