**1:** Comment of the week is Seth Schoen’s description of [a Wikipedia fight over the book ](/p/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/comment/43253327)_[A Void](/p/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/comment/43253327)_ \- the book is famous for not using the letter “e”, and the Wikipedians argued about whether it was appropriate for its article to operate under the same constraint. See also [Melvin’s response](/p/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/comment/43264131).
