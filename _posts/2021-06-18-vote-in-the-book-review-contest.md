Thanks for reading the entries in this very delayed (and then very protracted) book review contest. 

Please [vote for your favorites here](https://forms.gle/cHmGt859uyBb6Nns5), using approval voting (ie vote for however many you want).

I’ll probably keep voting open until the end of June in case you want a chance to go back and re-read your favorites. In case you’ve forgotten, the finalists are:
