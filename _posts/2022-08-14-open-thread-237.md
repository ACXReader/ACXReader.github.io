This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:**_Asterisk_ is an upcoming effective altruist magazine currently headquartered in my spare bedroom. My friend Clara is editor and the first issue will feature articles by me, Kelsey Piper, and other people you might know. Go to [asteriskmag.com](http://asteriskmag.com/) to check it out and sign up for the mailing list.

**2:** I’m still interested in testing some prompts on one of the bigger post-DALLE2 image models (PARTI? Imagen?) in order to resolve a bet. Please get in touch with me (scott@slatestarcodex.com) if you can help.
