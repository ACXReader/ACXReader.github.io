_(inspired by[Aid Airdrop Kills Five People In Gaza After Parachute Fails](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/3/8/fatal-aid-drop-over-gaza-as-parachutes-fail))_

When God placed Man upon the earth  
In days of God knows when  
He said to love the Lord your God  
And love your fellow men

It's safe enough to love the Lord  
In worship or in song  
The Lord your God is far away  
And very, very strong

But he who loves his fellow man  
Must careful be, and agile  
For fellow men are very close  
And very, very fragile

So Midgley, Marx, and Mao, and more  
All had their tale to tell  
They tried to help their fellow men  
And pushed them into Hell

And Galton, Ehrlich, Robespierre  
Corbusier and Kipling  
All saw their actions ripple out  
And worsen in the rippling

And every time you throw a coin  
Into a beggar's jar  
The coin could strike the beggar's face  
And leave him with a scar

And every slice of bread you give  
To a child starved and broke  
Could lodge the wrong way in his throat  
And cause the kid to choke

The best laid plans of mice and men  
Are oft unwisely laid  
And end with Palestinians  
Struck dead by falling aid

When young, I learned philosophy  
At many a scholar's door  
And all the wisdom that I learned  
Came down to options four:

  * To make your heart as hard as stone  
Like the heart of a machine  
And sit there supercilious  
Because your hands are clean

  * To pet your dog and kiss your kid  
And call your duty done  
While far away, the Gazan girls  
Are dropping one by one

  * To rush in bright and glorious  
'Neath the golden flag of Good  
Then apologize at leisure to  
Men crushed by falling food

  * Or to creep in like accountants  
Using gain and loss as anchors  
As cunning as the serpents  
And as cold as Wall Street bankers




When I was young, I fought among  
The golden-flagged crusaders  
But now Iâ€™m old, and now I stand  
Beside the snakes and traders

So when my plans go all awry  
And my name becomes a curse  
I can say the other option was  
Eleven utils worse

And if upon the Judgment Day  
God comes to me in wrath  
I'll have a PowerPoint prepared  
To prove I did the math

And if, upon the Judgment Day  
God says my math is wrong  
I'll tell Him He is far away  
And very, very strong

But man is very, very close  
And very, very brittle  
And we can only do our best  
Or sit there, noncommital

And so we sighed, and multiplied  
And after that, we prayed  
For souls of Palestinians  
Struck dead by falling aid.
