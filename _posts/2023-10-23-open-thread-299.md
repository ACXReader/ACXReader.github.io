This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Open Philanthropy Project (multi-billion-dollar EA-ish grantmaker) asks me to mention that [they're looking to hire more people for "grantmaking, research, and operations" roles](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/), especially in AI policy, technical AI alignment, and biosecurity/pandemic preparedness. Location varies between SF, DC, and remote, pay is mostly between $100K and $150K, and jobs require some combination of good reasoning skills, research skills, organizedness, and domain knowledge (not all jobs require all four of those things). I can't say enough good things about current Open Phil employees - you would be working with some of the brightest and most interesting people in the world. [Q&A with some Open Phil employees about the new hiring round here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/peLstYwka2EzxiNG7/ama-six-open-philanthropy-staffers-discuss-op-s-new-gcr); if youâ€™re interested, [apply](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/#9-application-form) before November 9.
