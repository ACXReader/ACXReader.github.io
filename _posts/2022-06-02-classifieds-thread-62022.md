This is the bimonthly (?) classifieds thread. Advertise whatever you want in the comments.

We’re going to try keeping it organized again, so please respond to the appropriate top-level comment:**Employment, Dating, Read My Blog**(also includes podcasts, books, etc)**, Consume My Product/Service,** or **Other.** I’ll delete anything that’s not in the appropriate category.

Remember that posting dating ads is hard and scary. Please refrain from commenting too negatively on anyone’s value as a human being. I’ll be much less strict about employers, bloggers, etc.

And here are some extra dating profiles of people I know of and like:

[Lulie](https://www.lulie.co.uk/date-me/) (F / 32 / Oxford + Waterloo)  
[Kathy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LkBlL5T4ocCoL4okfJEa6Jqds16ZhfLFtKklbry_DG4/edit) (NB / 28 / Massachusetts)  
[Nathan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Stk3XS_cbQpFdjo4LYdcwMqWxbCF4b5pcROBn8JcR9Q/edit#) (M / 28 / London)  
[Richard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14iR0P1MQ8DdyoUXv_3_K1aWewwf1wRXIxwWHy-GuG3Y/edit) (M / 27 / SF)
