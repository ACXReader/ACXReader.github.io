This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

 **1:** Thanks to everyone who pushed back against my overly cynical post on college admissions. Some of the best responses were [Yes, Students At Elite Schools Are Actually Taught Different Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/14x2oyp/yes_students_at_elite_schools_are_actually_taught/), and the several people (eg [Raghu Parthasarathy](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-match-school-and-student-rank/comment/18381695)) pointing out that smart people want to socialize with other smart people.

 **2:** Heads up that I’ll probably be having a Berkeley meetup this coming Sunday (7/23) and an NYC meetup the Sunday after that (7/30). I’m still finalizing plans and can’t guarantee either of them, I’m just letting you know to keep the date open if you want. I’ll make a top-level post about both if they end up happening.

 **3:** In 2020, using data from the SSC survey, I wrote about how [Autogenderphilia Is Common And Not Especially Associated With Transgender](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/10/autogenderphilia-is-common-and-not-especially-related-to-transgender/). More recently, Aella did another survey [and found the same thing](https://aella.substack.com/p/everyone-has-autogynephilia). Last week Michael Bailey, a researcher who thinks autogynephilia is very associated with transgender, [responded here](https://twitter.com/AporiaMagazine/status/1678339832798490624), saying that our questions were bad. Tailcalled, who helped write the questions for Aella and my survey, [explains here why they think the questions were good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oHn8yvzn5uGvPYmsb/i-think-michael-bailey-s-dismissal-of-my-autogynephilia). Instead of having an opinion on this, I plan to ask Michael to design the questions for the next survey and demonstrate that they get the same result.

 **4:** The Progress Studies cabal is offering the [Roots Of Progress Blog Building Intensive [Fellowship]](https://fellowship.rootsofprogress.org/); apply if you blog about science and progress and want to do more of that. If accepted, you’ll get a free intensive writing program, a chance to talk with experts, and a free trip to an in person event in SF. Advisors include Tyler Cowen, Steven Pinker, Tamara Winter, and lots of other impressive people.
