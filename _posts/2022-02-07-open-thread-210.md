This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

**1:** We now have a “report comment” button! If someone posts a terrible comment, click the three dots after “Reply”:

…and choose “Report Comment” on the menu. This will send it to me so I can check if it merits a banning. Remember, ACX rules are that comments should be at least _two_ of polite, relevant, and plausibly-true-according-to-me. This means I do _not_ generally delete comments for being false (ie “misinformation”) unless they are also rude or irrelevant. However, I may also unprincipledly delete comments that bring shame and/or negative media attention upon this blog, depending on how much shame and negative media attention I’m up for that particular day. And I may occasionally delete comments I think are stupid and lowering the average level of debate.

**2:** Some updates to my [Predictions for 2022](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/predictions-for-2022-contest), especially relevant if you’re playing in the related [contest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZ3UC9JIuhFdlVM_xYtj60a6ba7elWGiAnROMobkFXM/edit): First, I misinterpreted Matt Yglesias’ question about a Q4 2021 recession as being about a Q4 2022 recession, so my prediction on it is dumb and you should ignore it - for your own contest entries, please predict the Q4 2021 recession, as Matt did. Second, for unclear reasons I gave the wrong current floor value for Bored Apes; I will be judging the prediction on whether they end up lower than the real floor price as of last week ($320K), _not_ whether they end up lower than the false number I gave. Sam and Eric can weigh in on how they’re going to judge this in the contest.

**3:** Somebody sent in an ACX Grant application saying they didn’t want any money, but they wanted data on my grantmaking process for their study on what makes teams succeed. I took this out of my pile intending to come back to it after the grants round, and then I lost it. If that was you, please send me an email at scott@slatestarcodex.com reminding me what I can do for you.

**4:** Remember, if you won an ACX Grant I am willing to provide updates and advertisements for your project on Open Threads. ACX Grants winner Yoram Bauman writes:

> **One paragraph summary of Jan 2022 progress on #climate24x7 (advancing smart climate efforts in the legislature and/or via 2024 ballot measures in at least 7 states):** In **Nebraska** , climate-concerned R state senator [John McCollister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._McCollister) introduced [LB944](https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=46715), a short 3-page bill that cuts the regressive 5.5% state sales tax rate on electricity once electric utilities hit certain carbon intensity targets; see these [one-pagers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWiVM4Ii-XJGsvk2z99pGbiQWUs5p27aXDCbI543N2Y/edit?usp=sharing). We have a page of potential improvements based feedback from utility folks and others and are anticipating a public hearing in late February or early March. A similar idea is making progress in **South Dakota** , where a D legislator has expressed interest in similar legislation, and in **Arizona** , where I’ve hired Autumn Johnson of [Tierra Strategy](https://tierrastrategy.com/) to pursue this; we’ve written [one-pagers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBw0rQPa0s8Dd0Gp0BBbjPtvyOXuFQjOALVZ3hYNQ4o/edit?usp=sharing) and [draft legislation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRUntuEY9VN-J3Seb96lQFsqF2OdlNuk/edit), she’s gotten fairly positive feedback from utilities, enviros, and legislative staff, and we’re doing our best to find a House member to introduce legislation before the cut-off of Friday Feb 4. In **Utah** we continue to work on the signature-gathering [plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1knZzp2aYdkmmfDVV24M-LBfNz1q0BvSITBReNVaKYY0/edit?usp=sharing) for the [Clean The Darn Air](https://www.cleanthedarnair.org/) 2024 ballot measure effort; we also anticipate the introduction of a similar bill in this year’s legislative session. Also trying to push forward with ideas or exploratory conversations in **Colorado** , **Georgia** , **Massachusetts** , and **Michigan**. Additional funding would help extend Autumn’s contract and help push forward faster in Nebraska, South Dakota, and elsewhere!

**5:** In the comment section of [Why Do I Suck?](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-do-i-suck), someone linked this Scholars’ Stage post on [Why Public Intellectuals Have Short Shelf Lives](https://scholars-stage.org/public-intellectuals-have-short-shelf-lives-but-why/), which I found interesting.
