I’ll be in Austin on Sunday, 2/27, and the meetup group there has kindly agreed to host me and anyone else who wants to show up.

We’ll be at [UPDATED WITH CHANGE} Moontower Cider Company at 1916 Tillery St from noon to 3. The organizer is sbarta@gmail.com , you can contact him if you have any questions.

As per usual procedure, everyone is invited. Please feel free to come even if you feel awkward about it, even if you’re not “the typical ACX reader”, even if you’re worried people won’t like you, etc.

You may (but don’t have to) RSVP [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/events/95LYeapL9ZiRgp689/scott-alexander-visit-and-mixer).
