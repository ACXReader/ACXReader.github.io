This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** GiveWell is looking for a Head of Operations, probably someone with many years of leadership experience. Compensation $250K - 300K, remote work acceptable. [See here for more details](https://boards.greenhouse.io/givewell/jobs/4048923008?gh_src=173bb58b8us).

**2:** New subscriber only post, [The Mistakes Are All Waiting To Be Made](/p/the-mistakes-are-all-waiting-to-be), on my very early experience as a parent. Current plan is to make most parenting posts subscriber-only to prevent too much information about my kids from getting all over the Internet, sorry.

**3:** I may have to remove one of the book review finalists, _Sixth Day And Other Tales_ , for voting irregularities. If you wrote the review, please get in touch with me (scott@slatestarcodex.com) so we can try to figure out what happened.
