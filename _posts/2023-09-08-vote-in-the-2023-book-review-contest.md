If you’ve read the finalists of this year’s book review contest, **[vote for your favorite here](https://forms.gle/yK6Hyv6nt9Kt2X3AA)**. Voting will stay open until Wednesday.

Thanks to a helpful reader who offered to do the hard work, we’re going to try ranked choice voting. You’ll choose your first-, second-, and third-favorite book reviews. If your favorite gets eliminated, we’ll switch your vote to your second favorite, and so on. If for some reason I can’t figure out how to make this work on time, I’ll switch to first-past-the-post, ie only count your #1 vote. Feel free to vote for your own review, as long as you honestly choose your second and third favorites.

In case you need a refresher, here are the finalists, in order of appearance:
