This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Some new alignment orgs are looking for help, including a UK-based technical org interested in seed funding; they'll be seeking formal grants later but want to start up quickly. Theyâ€™re looking for mid six-figures total, but not up to coordinating lots of small donors and interested in talking to people who can provide a substantial fraction of that total ($50K+). Email me at [scott@slatestarcodex.com](mailto:scott@slatestarcodex.com) for more information.

**2:** European Summer Program on Rationality team is offering 10 day workshops on rationality and AI this summer in the UK for 16-20 year olds; free tuition, some travel scholarships available, [see here for more details](https://espr.camp/2023-camps).
