Each year, I post a reader survey. This helps me learn who’s reading this blog. But it also helps me try to replicate a bunch of psych findings, and investigate interesting hypotheses. Some highlights from past years include [birth order effects](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/), [mathematical interests vs. corn-eating style](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/15/kernel-of-doubt-testing-math-preference-vs-corn-eating-style/), [sexual harassment victimization rates in different fields](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/17/ssc-survey-results-sexual-harassment-levels-by-field/), [and whether all our kids are going to have autism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/28/assortative-mating-and-autism/). 

This year’s survey will probably take 20 - 40 minutes (source: it took me 15 minutes, but I knew all the questions beforehand, so I think it will take other people longer). As an incentive to go through this, I’ll give free one-year paid subscriptions to five randomly-selected survey respondents. The survey will be open until about January 15, so try to take it before then.
