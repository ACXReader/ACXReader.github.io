This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** More meetups this week: NYC, DC, Seattle, Atlanta, San Diego, Salt Lake, Madrid, Zurich, Hyderabad, Rio, Taipei. And a new meetup has been added for Zwolle. See [the list](/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2024) for more information.

**2:** Possible correction by Natalia to my Lumina post: [there might not have been three different trials](/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic/comment/54107727), my objections [here](/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic/comment/54133007), Nataliaâ€™s response [here](/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic/comment/54167671). I am still confused by this situation, for the reasons discussed.

**3:** Some good third-party analyses of the survey, including [Philosophy Bear on political orientation and altruism](https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/altruistic-kidney-donation-initiators) and [sebjenseb on a bunch of things including joint hypermobility](https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/analysis-of-ssc-survey).
