This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** Comment of the week is [Vosmyorka describing political polarization](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-164#comment-1552377) (or lack thereof) in the most recent Dutch election.

2: In my review of _Antifragile_ , I repeated Nassim Taleb’s claim, sourced to history Guy Beaujouan, that “before the thirteenth century no more than five persons in the whole of Europe knew how to perform a division”. Here’s [some discussion](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/15130/did-only-a-handful-of-people-in-europe-know-how-to-do-division-before-the-13th-c) on whether that’s true.
