At the beginning of every year, I make predictions. At the end of every year, I score them. Here are [2014](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/2014-predictions-calibration-results/), [2015](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/02/2015-predictions-calibration-results/), [2016](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/31/2016-predictions-calibration-results/), [2017](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/02/2017-predictions-calibration-results/), [2018](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/22/2018-predictions-calibration-results/), [2019](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/08/2019-predictions-calibration-results/), and [2020](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/2020-predictions-calibration-results).

And here are the predictions I made for 2021 (in April; I was really late). Bolded statements happened, italicized statements did not happen (as of 1/1/22). Neither-bold-nor-italic resolved ambiguous.

We have a debate every year over whether 50% predictions are meaningful in this paradigm; feel free to continue it.

** _107\. I double my current amount of money ($1000) on PredictIt: 10%_  
**108\. I post my scores on these predictions before 3/1/22: 70%**

To make binning easier, I’ve converted 5% predictions into 95% predictions of the opposite, 10% predictions into 90% predictions of the opposite, and so on. So:

Of 50% predictions, I got 7 right and 6 wrong, for a total of 54%  
Of 60% predictions, I got 11 right and 11 wrong, for a total of 50%  
Of 70% predictions, I got 20 right and 6 wrong, for a total of 77%  
Of 80% predictions, I got 20 right and 3 wrong, for a total of 87%  
Of 90% predictions, I got 10 right and 1 wrong, for a total of 91%  
Of 95% and 99% predictions, I got 8 right and 0 wrong, for a total of 100%

Here’s the usual graph:

Last year I was mostly overconfident. This year I was very slightly underconfident (except in the 60% bin). I see no consistent pattern of errors here and am not going to update on it very much. I’m pretty happy with this, since I thought the questions this year were harder than usual.

Simon M [did a similar exercise on Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/A7yccktTp8LDjSizp/scott-alexander-2021-predictions-market-prices-resolution), and compared me to Zvi and to various prediction markets. This was slightly biased against me, because Zvi got to see my guesses first and choose which ones to adjust on, and the markets are the markets. Still, he found:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ec0207-ac8b-4f04-bb8a-b2c9fbfda02b_202x182.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7ec0207-ac8b-4f04-bb8a-b2c9fbfda02b_202x182.png)

…where lower scores are better. So Zvi beat me, and the markets beat both of us. This is fine; nobody should be able to beat the market consistently, and the market was able to (though probably didn’t bother to) read both Zvi’s and my estimates.

I’ll post predictions for this coming year next week.
