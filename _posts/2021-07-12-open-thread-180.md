This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

**1:** Deiseach is banned for one day, and jstr given a warning, for their exchange in Hidden Open Thread 178.5. Probably many other people should be banned or warned, but given that there’s no Report Comment function here I don’t have a great way of hearing about it. At some point I might try to figure out a solution.

**2:** Thanks to everyone who sent in surveys for the reader survey. My current plan is to process the last few submissions over the next few days, post a final check to make sure everything is as expected on Tuesday or Wednesday, then post all the surveys around Friday. This is not a promise, and sorry for any delays that might pop up here.

**3:** I didn’t know this when writing the [Book Review Winners](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-contest-winners) post, but Boštjan, who wrote [the review of](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-double-fold) _Double Fold_ , has a whole blog about book-preservation-related issues, [The Fate Of Books](https://thefateofbooks.wordpress.com/). If you enjoyed the review, consider checking it out. And although I’m posting this one in particular here because I missed it, also check out the blogs of the various other winners and finalists, which are posted on the thread.
