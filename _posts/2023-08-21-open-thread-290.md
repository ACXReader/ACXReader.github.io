Also:

 **1:** ACX Grantees Will Jarvis and Lars Doucet ([the Georgism guy!](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty)) report "tremendous progress" on their company ValueBase, which helps governments implement Georgist land value taxes. They describe partnerships with a major US city and a foreign country (they're not ready to say which ones just yet) and an upcoming research paper. They got their pre-seed funding [from Sam Altman](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/valuebase-backed-by-sam-altmans-hydrazine-raises-1-6-million-seed-round/), but are now raising a seed round to scale up operations (looking for seven-figure amounts). Please email [will@valuebase.co](mailto:will@valuebase.co) if you're interested.

 **2:** Comments on this monthâ€™s links: EATS act (banning California from putting animal welfare standards on meat) is definitely constitutional ([1](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-august-2023/comment/22133756), [2](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-august-2023/comment/22127925)); defense of Republican concerns that PEPFAR money is being used to promote abortion ([1](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-august-2023/comment/22127865), [2](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-august-2023/comment/22171207)).
