This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** So far we haven’t gotten any investors in [the impact market](https://manifund.com/); I tried to design it so that returns would be very high if there was only one investor and gradually go down as more investors came in, so right now there’s the potential for pretty high returns, although those will go away if too many people follow after you’ve got them.

**2:** A few months ago, I talked to someone at Substack about a probabilistically-showing-comments moderation solution, but I forgot your name. If that was you, please email me at scott[at]slatestarcodex[dot]com; thanks!
