This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In other news:

**1:**[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/midterms), [Manifold](https://manifold.markets/post/us-2022-midterms), and [PredictIt ](https://www.predictit.org/)now have shiny interfaces for predicting the upcoming US midterm elections. In terms of the Republicans taking the Senate, Polymarket is at 65%, Manifold at 58%, PredictIt at 73%, and [538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/) at 49%.

**2:** Comment of the week is [by Stephen Zerfas, ](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/nick-cammarata-on-jhana/comment/10020159)describing his work on [Jhourney](https://www.jhourney.io/), a startup making neurofeedback headsets that can help you reach jhana more easily (see also [their FAQ](https://www.jhourney.io/faqs)). In case you ever wonder how realistic my short stories are, I did first meet Stephen and hear him explain his headset startup at a Bay Area house party.

**3:** I’m encountering some moderation-related technical difficulties. Some people who deserve bans haven’t gotten them, and some people who deserved short bans have gotten perma-bans. If you have been banned for longer than I said you would, feel free to email me so I can correct this.
