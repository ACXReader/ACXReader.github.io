Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for ACX meetup organizers. Volunteers have arranged meetups in 205 cities around the world, including Penryn, Cornwall and Baghdad, Iraq.

You can find the list below, in the following order:

  1. Africa & Middle East

  2. Asia-Pacific (including Australia)

  3. Canada

  4. Europe (including UK)

  5. Latin America

  6. United States




You can see a map of all the events on [the LessWrong community page](https://www.lesswrong.com/community).

Within each section, it’s alphabetized first by country/state, then by city - so the first entry in Europe is Vienna, **A** ustria. Sorry if this is confusing.

I will provisionally be attending the meetups in Berkeley, Los Angeles, and San Diego. ACX meetups coordinator Mingyuan will provisionally be attending Paris and London. I’ll be announcing some of the biggest ones on the blog, regardless of whether or not I attend.

**Extra Info For Potential Attendees**

**1.** If you’re reading this, you’re invited. Please don’t feel like you “won’t be welcome” just because you’re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You’ll be fine!   
**2**. You don’t have to RSVP or contact the organizer to be able to attend (unless the event description says otherwise); RSVPs are mostly to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up, and let them tell you if there are last-second changes. I’ve also given email addresses for all organizers in case you have a question. 

**Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:  
  
1.** If you’re the host, bring a sign that says “ACX MEETUP” and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).  
**2.** Bring blank labels and pens for nametags.  
**3.** Have people type their name and email address in a spreadsheet or in a Google Form (accessed via a bit.ly link or QR code), so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.  
**4.** If it’s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and if you try to organize some kind of “fun” “event” it’ll probably just be annoying.  
**5.** It’s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you’re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.  
**6.** In case people want to get to know each other better outside the meetup, you might want to mention [reciprocity.io](https://www.reciprocity.io/), the rationalist friend-finder/dating site.  
**7.** If you didn’t make a LessWrong event for your meetup, the LessWrong team did it for you using the email address you gave here. To claim your event, log into LW (or create an account) using that email address, or message the LW team on Intercom (chat button in the bottom right corner of lesswrong.com).

If you need to change a meetup date or you have any other questions, please email meetupsmingyuan@gmail.com.

Afterwards we went to have dinner and continued talking about everything and anything for hours. Everything is new and flexible, so come and help us improve!

**Group info:** We meet around 20-25 times a year but it is asymmetrical, focused in summer, Christmas and Easter. We discuss opinions, engage in circling, play games where we spot logical fallacies and biases by attacking our members ideological weakpoints and formalize some debating stances. Occasionally we find the willpower to devote meetups in steelmanning and understanding the outgroup (roughly 4-5 times a year)  
**Notes:** If you are into ACX enough to see this post, I believe we have enough common ground to be worth meeting each other. Aren't you curious who else is within this niche community in Rome? Come on, take a leap of faith. P.S. Would be nice if you sent me a message in WhatsApp with your name and probability of attendance, but I love walk-ins just fine. No space limit after all ;-)

Go inside and ask them to show you to The Deck. We'll have a sign.

**Group info:** We started in the 2018 Meetups Everywhere and is still going strong. We aim to meet about once every two weeks. At most meetups we get about 5-7 people out of a rotation of 15-20; Meetups Everywhere and other special events tend to bring in a few more than usual. We're a totally social meetup with no 'format' or suggested readings. Although it's not rare for us to touch on ACX articles and related topics, the conversation varies wildly, and you are welcome even if you're the most occasional ACX reader.  
**Notes:** We have a (not very active) [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JEnfefn) where you can DM me or post on a public channel. I'm most responsive by email. There is a small chance we'll have to change the location to somewhere else in Northampton. Please check the Less Wrong or Facebook posts on or after August 26 to get the final word on location.

**BELLINGHAM, WA**  
**Contact:** Alex, bellinghamrationalish[at]gmail[dot]com  
**Time:** Thursday, September 29, 5:30 PM  
**Location:** Lake Padden Park, at one of the tables near the lake by the dog park. If it's rainy, we'll meet in one of the two covered gazebo areas just north (right, if you're facing the lake) of the planned spot. If the forecast looks _really_ bad (e.g. very cold), I'll post an indoor location to the Meetup.com page at least three days in advance.

**Notes:** Please [RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bellingham-rationalish-community/events/287869950/) so I have an idea how many people to expect. Kids, animals, food, beverages, etc. are all welcome.
