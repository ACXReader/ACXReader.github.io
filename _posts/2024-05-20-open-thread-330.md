This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** More meetups this week, including Austin, Bangalore, and Berlin. See [the meetups list](/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2024) for more information.

**2:** Thanks to everyone who’s rated the book reviews. If you missed Friday’s post and feel up to rating book reviews, [take a look](/p/choose-book-review-finalists-2024). I’ve corrected the link to the L - P reviews, and [the link to Taymon’s random-review-picker](https://us-central1-acx-book-review-contest-2023.cloudfunctions.net/random-review-2024).

**3:** Many thanks to Substack, who have streamlined some code to make ACX comments load faster. More information - and a link to contact the engineers involved - [here](/p/open-thread-329/comment/56618392).
