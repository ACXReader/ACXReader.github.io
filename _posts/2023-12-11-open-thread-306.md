This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

 **1:** Comments of the week: Timothy Johnson tries to explain [why Taylor Swift is such a big deal](/p/mantic-monday-12423/comment/44813135); Waldo explains [why regulated businesses might sue their regulators even when trying to stay on their good side](/p/mantic-monday-12423/comment/44819675); and Scott Aaronson [sets the record straight on his beliefs about AI risk](/p/mantic-monday-12423/comment/44819549). And I previously said I couldn’t find the source of a poll claiming that the median American estimated a 26% chance AI would kill all humans, but an alert reader [found it here](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/us-public-perception-of-cais-statement-and-the-risk-of-extinction). Remember that ordinary people aren’t good at asserting probabilities, and also that medians don’t always present the full picture; see the link for more details.

 **2:** A few years ago [I wrote about embryo screening](/p/welcome-polygenically-screened-babies), where people doing IVF with multiple embryos could determine which embryo had the healthiest genes and implant that one. That post focused on a the company called [LifeView](https://www.lifeview.com/), mostly because they were the only ones offering the service at the time. Now new company [Orchid Health](https://www.orchidhealth.com/) wants me to mention that they are also offering this service. They claim to screen for more rare single-gene disorders than LifeView, as well as the usual polygenic screening for common problems like diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimers (although they may also be more expensive). Their [Science](https://www.orchidhealth.com/science) and [Clinician](https://www.orchidhealth.com/clinician-information) pages have more information, and their [signup link is here](https://www.orchidhealth.com/).

 **3:** A few years ago I started the Psychiatlist, a list of psychiatrists and therapists endorsed by ACX readers (though not checked by me). I let it lapse pretty badly for a while, but some good work by Erik Anderson and Josh Haas has it up and running again at [psychiatlist.astralcodexten.com](https://psychiatlist.astralcodexten.com/). Thanks especially to Erik for kickstarting this process (and by the way he is a therapist on the list, based in Southern California).

 **4:** Since I was pretty gung ho about the Lumina tooth probiotic, I want to link the good criticism I found as a counterbalance (without necessarily endorsing it). Here’s [someone from Hacker News doubting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38565695) that it will colonize the mouth (or do much if it does) - though see comments below. Here’s [an endodontist talking about](/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq/comment/45004350) how hard it is to study this or get any evidence that it works. Some other people pointed out that the graph on the post shows only 50% colonization after one year; Aaron says he has other information showing it eventually reaches near 100% colonization and he’ll get that to me soon. Some people were extremely skeptical about whether any of this was even real, so [here’s an NYT article about the original Hillman research from 2004](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/health/bacteria-enlisted-for-new-trials-on-dental-health.html) that will hopefully put those doubts to rest. I agree that there isn’t proof of efficacy and it will be hard to prove that, but I think the suggestive evidence compares well to other supplements I respect (albeit not $20K supplements), and no one in the comments had a good story for why it would cause harm - so I chose to take the free sample. I’ll let you know if anything terrible happens to me! Till then, you can also check [the prediction markets](https://manifold.markets/browse?q=lantern&s=score&f=open&ct=ALL&topic=for-you).

 **5:** I was also hoping to link criticism of my kidney post, but the author has deleted it. My memory of the argument was that, although studies don’t find easily-measured disadvantages, you might still want to have a prior that donating makes you feel worse in hard-to-measure ways like tiredness. There are studies that say it doesn’t impact quality of life, but this is a very subjective measurement and maybe these studies are wrong. My counterargument is that I have seen people with one kidney do very high-level work and lead multi-billion dollar organizations, and also there are some pretty advanced quality-of-life screening measures that really do fail to show any effect. I can’t rule out that it affects quality of life only in advanced age (I suspect there are studies that will disprove this somewhere, but I can’t remember if the studies I saw looked at this subgroup). I continue not to believe this argument, but am providing it so as to not recommending a drastic action without presenting all possible counterarguments.

 **6:** On Friday I asked people with interesting charitable projects to [apply for the new round of ACX Grants](/p/apply-for-an-acx-grant-2024). Reading the first few applications, I’m seeing some that would be a better match for angel investors. If you’re in this category and want to see some proposals, please email me at scott@slatestarcodex.com.
