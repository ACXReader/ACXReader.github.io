We have two Southern California meetups this weekend:

  * **Los Angeles** at 6:30 PM Saturday October 8 at 11841 Wagner St, Culver City.

  * **San Diego** at 3 PM on Sunday, October 9, at Bird Park, [these coordinates](https://plus.codes/8544PVQ8+Q7).




See [here ](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/meetups-everywhere-2022-times-and)for more details.

I _think_ I’ll be able to make it to both; if for some reason that changes I’ll try to update you by Open Thread beforehand.

Feel free to come even if you’ve never been to a meetup before, even if you only recently started reading the blog, even if you’re not “the typical ACX reader”, even if you hate us and everything we stand for, etc. There are usually 50-100 people at these so you should be able to lose yourself in the crowd.

Also coming up this weekend are meetups in Boise, Austin, Salt Lake City, Tokyo, Toulouse, Cologne, Rome, Hatten, Poznan, St. Louis, Rochester (NY), Seattle, Mumbai, and Oklahoma City. You can find times and places [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/meetups-everywhere-2022-times-and).
