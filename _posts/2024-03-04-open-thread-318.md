This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Comments of the week: [UncleWeyland on what it would mean for Alzheimers to be/not be a prion disease](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1b30yq6/links_for_february_2024/ksrxbkr/). And Richard Fuisz says the RIMS1 gene (mentioned in the links post; postulated to cause blindness + increased IQ) [doesn’t actually make you blind](https://twitter.com/richardfuisz/status/1763366885188391082?s=46); nobody has checked the IQ claim yet, but [here’s how Richard thinks about it](https://twitter.com/richardfuisz/status/1763591765620121990). And a correction: the article about phages was from [Asimov Press](https://www.asimov.press/), not [Works In Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/).

**2:** Last year Manifold Markets held a prediction market conference/festival, Manifest, in Berkeley. I thought it was a lot of fun. They’re going to do it again this year, June 7 to 9th, you can get tickets [here](https://www.manifest.is/#tickets), cheaper early bird tickets ($249) are first come, first serve.

**3:** I won’t have a voting guide up in time for the California primary on Tuesday, but Jessica Ocean of the PsychCrisis blog [has interesting thoughts on Proposition 1](https://psychcrisis.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-prop-1) (mental health funding).
