This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** New bans for [Timothy W,](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/constitutional-ai-rlhf-on-steroids/comment/15763456) [Bruce P](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-272/comment/14823706#comment-14838443), [Anna M](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/conspiracies-of-cognition-conspiracies/comments#comment-11869296), [Melchizedek](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/you-dont-want-a-purely-biological/comment/12278903), [Phil T](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/kelly-bets-on-civilization/comment/13388171), [Bi_Gates](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-271/comment/14570618), and [Finnydo](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-from-oversight-to-overkill/comment/14890102). New warnings for [Cerastes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-is-the-academic-job-market-so/comment/16737911), [John of Orange](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/change-my-mind-density-increases/comment/15485288), [Eremolalos](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-paper-belt-on-fire/comment/16738207), [Robert L](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-267/comment/13551929), [Richard C](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/give-up-seventy-percent-of-the-way/comment/13435802), and [Fooooo](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/mr-tries-the-safe-uncertainty-fallacy/comment/14157118). Warnings don’t necessarily mean I don’t like you; they could also mean I like you enough that you have escaped a ban you otherwise deserve. And everyone, please avoid posting inflammatory comments where you don’t explain your reasoning or add anything helpful to the conversion.

**2:** Some link corrections: Canada’s population center [may not be in Michigan](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-may-2023/comment/16843937). Nisean horses [might be fake](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-may-2023/comment/16855670)? (although clearly by Roman/Byzantine times there were specific horses people _thought_ were Nisean) Australia’s National Sorry Day [is minor and not helpful](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-may-2023/comment/16780733). Maybe I was metamistaken in saying I was mistaken [about the bonobo study](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-may-2023/comment/16781791), I don’t even know anymore and will have to look into this in more depth.
