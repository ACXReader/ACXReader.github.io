This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

 **1:** New [spring meetups](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2023) added since I last updated you: Phoenix, Arizona; Melbourne, Australia. Check [the list](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2023) for dates and times 

**2:** Updates to points on the Links For April thread: [Max Tegmark explains the reasoning behind the 6 month AI pause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfceTsD0A); [North Dakota’s governor has vetoed the legislature’s plan to ban approval voting](https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/push-to-override-veto-of-approval-voting-ban-fails-in-north-dakota-senate). 

**3:** Last month I wrote [Against Ice Age Civilizations](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/against-ice-age-civilizations), arguing that civilization probably isn’t more than 12,000 years old. Samo Burja thinks it is and [arranged a Long Bet on longbets.org](https://longbets.org/933/). If archaeologists discover something at least as impressive as Gobekli Tepe from 11,000 BC or earlier before 2043, he wins $200; otherwise I do. 

**4:** Giving What We Can asks me to advertise that tomorrow is World Malaria Day and they're holding [a fundraiser here.](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/world-malaria-day-2023)
