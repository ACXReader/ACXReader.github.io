This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is even-numbered, so go wild - or post about whatever else you want. Also:

 **1:** A correction to [my post about Sasha’s LSD experience](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/what-should-we-make-of-sasha-chapins): I wrote that neurogenesis “probably doesn’t happen in adult humans, or if it does it’s rare and limited to specific areas”. Commenters found [some](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4071289/) [studies ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4968158/)showing that, at the very least, it does happen in the olfactory bulb, which would be relevant for smell. I still don’t think it happens quickly enough to explain Chapin recovering. **** I’ve [added this to my Mistakes page](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/mistakes).

 **2:** A lot of people reading that post overestimated whether psychedelics could help them with their own weird issues. Psychedelics are pretty well-tested (albeit informally) for things like chronic pain. They seem to work okay but not miraculously, kind of like everything else. I don’t think this necessarily means the mechanism doesn’t work - if you chose a random antibiotic and took one dose of it to prevent random sinus problems, that would probably also only work “okay”, since it would mix infective causes with non-infective causes, appropriate antibiotics with inappropriate antibiotics, and a single dose of antibiotic isn’t very effective anyway. I think psychedelics as treatment for things like chronic pain are at the “we should figure out the mechanism” stage and not the “patients can use this as a miracle cure” stage.

 **3:** I’m pretty annoyed by comments that say just things like “This is a bad post” or “You are clearly misinformed” without any elaboration. This is true whether it’s responding to me or to a commenter. I’m going to start banning these if I see them from now on. Feel free to challenge or criticize anything, but please share your reasoning. I will grudgingly allow things of the form “I’m an expert in this field and I just want to warn people this is wrong, though I don’t have enough time to explain how”. But if it’s just “u suck”, that’s a banning.
