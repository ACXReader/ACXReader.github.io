At the beginning of every year, I make predictions. At the end of every year, I score them (this year I’m very late). Here are [2014](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/2014-predictions-calibration-results/), [2015](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/02/2015-predictions-calibration-results/), [2016](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/31/2016-predictions-calibration-results/), [2017](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/02/2017-predictions-calibration-results/), [2018](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/22/2018-predictions-calibration-results/), and [2019](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/08/2019-predictions-calibration-results/).

And here are the predictions I made for 2020. Some predictions are redacted because they involve my private life or the lives of people close to me. Usually I use strikethrough for things that didn’t happen, but since Substack doesn’t let me strikethrough text or change its color or do anything interesting, I’ve had to turn the ones that didn’t happen into links. Italicized are getting thrown out because they were confusing or conditional on something that didn’t happen. I can’t decide if they’re true or not. All of these judgments were as of December 31 2020, not as of now.

(Remember, link means something that didn’t happen, not something I was wrong about. We have a debate every year over whether 50% predictions are meaningful in this paradigm; feel free to continue it.)

To make binning easier, I’ve converted 5% predictions into 95% predictions of the opposite, 10% predictions into 90% predictions of the opposite, and so on. So:

Of 50% predictions, I got 2 right and 7 wrong, for a total of 22%  
Of 60% predictions, I got 8 right and 8 wrong, for a total of 50%  
Of 70% predictions, I got 15 right and 6 wrong, for a total of 71%  
Of 80% predictions, I got 14 right and 8 wrong, for a total of 64%  
Of 90% predictions, I got 16 right and 3 wrong, for a total of 84%

Here’s the usual graph:

For the first time, I was consistently overconfident (below the green line of perfect calibration) in every bin (except 70%). It wasn’t a complete disaster, except at 50% (again, feel free to have your usual debate over whether 50% predictions are meaningful) and 95% (too low a sample size), but it was still bad.

Most of my mistakes were correlated with two big errors: expecting COVID lockdown to last much shorter than it did, and missing the NYT situation and its aftermath. This isn’t an excuse - part of what you’re supposed to do in being calibrated is understand the possibility that black swan events could happen that throw everything off. 

…except - wait. Is it an excuse? This year had more black swan events than usual; it was the weirdest year since I started doing these predictions in 2014. If you know that there will be frequent normal years but also some rare weird years, but you don’t know which are which, in order to get the right calibration overall you should end up looking slightly underconfident during normal years, and significantly overconfident during weird ones, to average out to the right level. In 2019 (which was pretty normal, as years go) I was 4% underconfident; this year I was about 10% overconfident. Maybe if I go back long enough it will all average out? Remind me to check this sometime.

Other possible lessons from this year: I apparently overestimate the likelihood that my friends’ relationships will stay together (but am pretty well-calibrated about mine). I’m bad at predicting my future purchasing decisions. I did a decent job predicting how much self-improvement I’d do, and it went okay.

Next up: I’m going to try to grade my predictions for the Trump administration, then make some more predictions in this format for next year. But along with that, I want to keep a running prediction log of things I’m actually blogging about, or things I’m thinking about at the time - you can see what I have so far [here](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2268.0.html).
