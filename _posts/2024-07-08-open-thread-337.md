This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Comment of the week is [Peter Gerdes here](/p/prediction-markets-suggest-replacing/comment/60688036), arguing that publicly pressuring Sotomayor to resign makes Sotomayor less likely to resign (because she can’t look like she’s giving in to political pressure). I [don’t know](/p/prediction-markets-suggest-replacing/comment/60722079) if I buy it, but worth thinking about.

**2:** Related: some Democrat friends have asked me to [signal-boost this post they wrote](https://maketrumploseagain.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-trump-call-your-representatives?utm-source=acx&fbclid=IwY2xjawD4l7pleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZRr_My-NacNEH1JMG3r-AJm33tfBISH5Ip8M8h6yQ7H9VQDTHOP331Oug_aem_V0Zk4_XaUiDUVyK8HqFMiQ) about why and how to help get Biden to step down (basically: other candidates do better in adjusted head-to-head polls; calling your representative will help).
