[_This is one of the finalists in the 2024 book review contest, written by an ACX reader who will remain anonymous until after voting is done. I’ll be posting about one of these a week for several months. When you’ve read them all, I’ll ask you to vote for a favorite, so remember which ones you liked_]

If you’re a follower of U.S. news outlets, you’ve seen some big stories unfolding over the past year: The unprecedented four criminal indictments lodged against former President Trump. The ongoing AI explosion. The backlash against “DEI,” “woke,” and “cancel culture” as exemplified by Elon Musk’s purchase and rebranding of Twitter to “X.” 

Visit a hundred different news sites, and you’ll get varying takes on these stories. Some will be liberal, some centrist, some conservative, some libertarian or neoreactionary or third-way or whatever. Most will attempt or feign objectivity (most badly). But all will largely be discussing the same stories.

And then there is one site where a _very different_ narrative is unfolding:

> _The admiral and several other officers were already in position when guards delivered [Merrick] Garland to the gallows at 10:05 a.m. He was led to the platform where the hangman and a rabbi awaited his arrival, one lowering the circle of rope and the other asking whether Garland wanted prayers recited as he transitioned to the afterlife._
> 
> _“Go f*** yourself,” Garland told the rabbi._
> 
> _Admiral Crandall asked Garland if he had any last words—besides insulting the rabbi._
> 
> _“I do, Crandall,” Garland said._
> 
> _A lengthy silence followed._
> 
> _“We don’t have all day,” the admiral said._
> 
> _Garland sneered. “You’re so far up Trump’s ass I can see the soles of your shoes.”_
> 
>  _“Clever,” the admiral said._
> 
> _The hangman put the noose around Garland’s neck and a cloth sack over his head._
> 
> _“Let’s do it,” the admiral said._
> 
> _The floor beneath Garland’s feet fell away, and he dropped. His neck snapped, ending his miserable life._

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to [Real Raw News.](https://realrawnews.com/)[^1]

#### The World According to Michael Baxter

Some people write fanfics about Harry Potter. Some people write fanfics about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And then, well, some people write fanfics about Donald Trump.

Spewing forth from a single WordPress site that doesn’t even display properly in mobile, Real Raw News presents itself as the lone bastion telling the _real_ story of what is going on in America, for everyone who isn’t fooled by the _fake news_ of all the other media outlets.

The articles of RRN are all the work of one Michael Baxter, and after enough time spent reading the site, one realizes that Baxter is no crank – he is instead a creative genius, the Michelangelo of fake news. Just as Michelangelo took four years to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling, Baxter has spent three and a half building his own elaborate world of plots, counterplots, and bloody, implacable justice.

At Real Raw News, Donald Trump is still president – just a temporarily embarrassed one, who has had to abandon the public-facing side of his job in order to lure the “Deep State” out of hiding into its own annihilation. 

In the world of Real Raw News, at least, it’s working. In this corner of the World Wide Web, America is going through a revolutionary purge rivaled only by the worst excesses of Joseph Stalin’s government – with the important difference that this time, the perpetrators thankfully all deserve it. 

The basic summary of the past four years of world history, according to RRN, are as follows:

  * Following widespread and blatant fraud in the 2020 election, endorsed as legitimate by the media, Donald Trump pretended to surrender power to Joe Biden. In reality, though, he [retained the support](https://realrawnews.com/2021/05/pentagon-coup-joint-chiefs-overthrown/) of the U.S. military, and continues to exercise presidential power from a secret bunker at Mar-a-Lago.

  * Military forces loyal to Trump, empowered by the Insurrection Act and other executive orders secretly placing the country under martial law, have been conducting special forces operations to hunt down and secretly arrest various high-profile Americans on charges of treason. 

  * Joe Biden, who is not really president and perhaps not really Joe Biden either, is somehow still exerting dictatorial powers over much of America, assisted by Deep State-aligned government agencies like the IRS, the FBI, and of course, FEMA. Any time there is a natural disaster, Trump-loyal military forces [do battle](https://realrawnews.com/2022/09/special-forces-save-child-from-evil-fema-agents/) with FEMA operatives. These battles have killed hundreds.

  * A chief goal of Biden’s not-really-in-power dictatorship is spreading Covid-19 vaccines, which are an evil plot to do…something. They contain ingredients like the [“zombie drug”](https://realrawnews.com/2022/07/scopolamine-found-in-child-covid-vaccines/) scopolamine, [pesticides](https://realrawnews.com/2022/05/military-finds-pesticides-in-moderna-covid-19-vaccines/), [HIV](https://realrawnews.com/2023/03/putin-exterminates-mad-covid-19-vaccine-scientist/), and [wasp venom](https://realrawnews.com/2022/07/wasp-venom-found-in-child-covid-shots/). Vaccines variously cause heart attacks, [mass sudden death](https://realrawnews.com/2022/11/uncounted-vaccine-deaths-on-our-highways-and-railways/), or [berserker rage](https://realrawnews.com/2023/08/heavily-vaxxed-pilot-goes-beserk-at-denver-international-airport/). 

  * Vladimir Putin launched the war in Ukraine to [hunt down](https://realrawnews.com/2024/04/putin-strikes-pedophile-compound-in-ukraine/) a network of child-trafficking pedophiles. The Deep State has some kind of weird plan to merge America with Ukraine.

  * The lack of evidence that all this is happening is entirely explained through coordinated media silence as well as the widespread use of body doubles and clones.




The heart of Real Raw News, and the source of most of its entertainment value, is its accounts of the supposed secret military tribunals occurring at America’s Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, better known as Gitmo[^2]. For more than three years, the site has produced one article after another describing the arrest, trial, and execution of dozens of major and not-so-major figures in American life. 

Hillary Clinton? [Arrested](https://realrawnews.com/2021/03/navy-seals-arrest-hillary-clinton/), [tried](https://realrawnews.com/2021/04/clinton-military-tribunal-day-5-conviction/), [executed](https://realrawnews.com/2021/04/hillary-clinton-hanged-at-gitmo/).

Bill Gates? [Arrested](https://realrawnews.com/2021/08/military-arrests-bill-gates/), [tried](https://realrawnews.com/2021/09/military-convicts-bill-gates/), [executed](https://realrawnews.com/2021/10/bill-gates-hanged-at-gimo-ahead-of-schedule/).

Dick Cheney? Fled the country via a [secret underground tunnel](https://realrawnews.com/2021/12/dick-cheney-flees-u-s-for-new-zealand/) to a CIA airfield, but then returned to America on vacation [for some reason](https://realrawnews.com/2021/12/dick-cheney-arrested/)[^3], arrested, [tried](https://realrawnews.com/2022/01/dick-cheney-convicted-of-treason-homicide/), [executed](https://realrawnews.com/2022/01/dick-cheney-hanged-at-gitmo/).

[George W. Bush](https://realrawnews.com/2022/01/george-w-bush-hanged-at-gitmo/), [Hunter Biden](https://realrawnews.com/2021/10/hunter-biden-hanged-at-gitmo/), [Anthony Fauci](https://realrawnews.com/2022/04/gitmo-double-header-execution-anthony-fauci-loretta-lynch/), [Gavin Newsom](https://realrawnews.com/2022/01/gavin-newsom-gets-death-penalty/), [Mark Milley](https://realrawnews.com/2023/10/mark-milley-hanged-at-gitmo/), [Victoria Nuland](https://realrawnews.com/2024/04/nuland-hanged-at-gitmo-ahead-of-schedule/), [Tom Hanks](https://realrawnews.com/2021/07/military-executes-tom-hanks/) (?), [Brian Stelter](https://realrawnews.com/2022/09/brian-stelter-executed/) (???) – All arrested and executed, in turn[^4]. Almost all defendants are hanged, which actually is not the method prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but has the advantage of being far more cinematic. 

It would be easy for all of this to get old, but like with [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_\(music\)) in classical music, subtle differences to each iteration enrich the whole. Some defendants desperately try to deny responsibility for their crimes. Some arrogantly taunt the tribunal, assuming until the very end that they are untouchable. Some literally scream as though demon-possessed. Some fake senility or amnesia. But crucially, all of them face justice, one way or another. 

An [entry](https://realrawnews.com/2024/05/jag-sentences-deep-state-judge-to-hang/) published just before this contest’s deadline is a lovely example:

> _Representing himself, [Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott] McAfee in opening remarks talked himself into an early verdict. He said no one and nothing, not even imprisonment, would prevent him from destroying the Trump family. Handcuffed at the defense table, he glared at the panel and said he would topple the Trump empire, building by building, brick by brick, and wouldn’t rest until every Trump supporter was behind bars or dead._
> 
> _“Then I’ll take care of the people here and this place,” McAfee said._
> 
> _“Mr. McAfee, I’m told you are of sound mind and know where you are, right?” Admiral Stephens asked_[^5] _._
> 
> _“I’m in a Kangaroo court in the Banana Republic of Trump, staring at a guy who couldn’t hack it in the real world, couldn’t run a private practice, get a partnership, or sit on a real bench, so he went into the military,” McAfee said._
> 
> _“Have you ever heard of Trump Derangement Syndrome, Mr. McAfee?” the Admiral asked. “Because you have the worst case I’ve seen, and I’ve seen several.”_
> 
>  _“Trump is finished. He’ll be in jail soon, and when he is, your house of cards collapses,” McAfee said._
> 
> _“It might seem that way, but it only seems that way,” the Admiral said._
> 
> _“You might as well find me guilty. I’ll never stop hating Trump and I’ll never stop working to demolish everything he stole. He was born guilty, and he’ll be guilty until the day he dies. That’ll be the only word on his gravestone: GUILTY!” McAfee shouted._
> 
> _The lead panelist, a Marine Corps major, politely interrupted: “Admiral, sir, we don’t have to hear any more. McAfee mocks this court, and we find him guilty of the treason charge. Additionally, we are in agreement he should hang for his crimes.”_
> 
>  _Admiral Stephens nodded contemplatively. “I side with these fine officers. Mr. McAfee, you are hereby sentenced to hang for treason against the United States of America.”_
> 
>  _His execution is scheduled for May 15._

Yes, this is the judge of Trump’s criminal case in Fulton County. In the Real Raw News world, Trump’s various legal adventures are both real and fake at the same time. Apparently, Trump could completely ignore these proceedings, and the military in fact begs him to do so, but he chooses to place himself in danger from some unseen, Christ-like self-sacrificial motive. 

That motive, it appears, is getting evil judges to expose their bias by ruling against him, so that they can be arrested and executed for treason. 

The site often offers an alternative narrative regarding events in the official, Deep State-backed news narrative. When Colin Powell died, RRN was there to explain that he actually [committed suicide](https://realrawnews.com/2021/10/colin-powell-committed-suicide/), fearing arrest by the military. When former Tom Hanks co-star Peter Scolari died of cancer, RRN swooped in to attribute his demise to an unexpected military tribunal[^6]. This pattern is one of the chief reasons fans cite for believing the site: Isn’t it incredible, they say, how some of the _same people_ RRN reports the executions of _just happen_ to have recently died or been hospitalized in the mainstream press? What are the odds?

Perhaps surprisingly, the star figure in Real Raw News’s tapestry of blood is not Donald Trump; like Gandalf or Dumbledore, he is a heroic but distant and largely off-screen figure. Instead, the primary hero is Rear Admiral Darse Crandall, who dispenses lethal justice with shocking efficiency while always being ready with a good quip:

> _Admiral Crandall ordered [Arizona Governor Katie] Hobbs not to intimidate the witness. “You lack decorum, detainee Hobbs, and your insouciance ends here. We revoke your right to further question this witness and ask the panel to render a verdict on the charges against you.”_
> 
>  _The admiral dismissed Jane Doe, and the panel unanimously found Hobbs guilty, recommending she hang to death._
> 
> _“I won’t let you do this to me,” Hobbs screeched._
> 
> _“It’s already done,” said Admiral Crandall. “And have a Merry Christmas—in whatever afterlife you wind up in.”_
> 
>  _He scheduled her execution for December 22._

Adm. Crandall is in fact a [real person](https://www.jag.navy.mil/about/leadership/darse-e-crandall/), currently serving as Judge Advocate General of the Navy. Admiral Crandall seems like a nice and professional fellow, and I badly want to know what he makes of his alternate persona. I like to hope that he enjoys it; maybe he jokingly warns his subordinates to do their jobs right or else they’ll be arrested and executed. If anybody knows otherwise, please do not disabuse me of this fantasy.

Lesser fake news auteurs will puke out lame one-and-done articles about the moon landing or JFK or whatever, with zero internal consistency. Baxter is better. His military tribunals are reported out in detail. Even the most minor figures receive dedicated articles for their arrest, their trial, and their demise, but the biggest names receive genuine weeks-long productions. Hillary Clinton’s tribunal spans five days, until [damning testimony](https://realrawnews.com/2021/04/clinton-military-tribunal-day-5-conviction/) from her former aide (and lover) Huma Abedin sends her to the gallows. Former president Bush’s arrest and tribunal is a ten-part epic lasting nearly two months, and includes details that are eccentric even by 9/11 truther standards: [Supposedly](https://realrawnews.com/2021/12/george-w-bush-military-tribunal-day-4-part-i/), the real death toll of 9/11 (which Bush orchestrated) was 7,000, but Bush deemed this number too high to win reelection, so the real number was suppressed and 4,000 families were silenced with enormous bribes that also served to stimulate the economy. Good thing all the plotting was caught on tape, or he might have gotten away with it. 

Baxter never rushes things. Remember how the Colorado Supreme Court tried to kick Trump off the primary ballot in late 2023? Lesser fake newsers might have had the entire 4-vote anti-Trump majority arrested at once, but Baxter is cannier. In his reporting, one justice was [arrested immediately](https://realrawnews.com/2023/12/marines-arrest-colorodo-scj-who-voted-to-remove-president-trump-from-state-ballot/), but the other three went on the run , and took [months](https://realrawnews.com/2024/04/jag-arrests-4th-treasonous-colorado-scj-melissa-hart/) to capture. As of this writing we’re _still_ waiting for their tribunal. I hope it’s a barn-burner!

Baxter knows that while crass wish fulfillment is easy, truly great stories need formidable villains. Amidst the many arrests and hangings of Baxter’s saga are cinematic setbacks. [Sometimes](https://realrawnews.com/2023/03/two-marines-die-in-failed-deep-state-arrest/), the Marines don’t get their man:

> _[Biden White House Covid-19 response coordinator Ashish] Jha was five feet away from his vehicle when two Marines with an arrest warrant approached him, informing him that he was being placed under arrest on charges of mass murder._
> 
> _Jha erupted in laughter, saying, “You don’t even know who we are.” He exploded in a crimson fireball that blew his and the Marines’ bodies to bits throughout the parking lot. […] The Marines brought what remains they could to Fort Bragg, where medical examiners deduced that Jha was not Jha, but a clone in which someone had planted a subdermal detonator connected to HMX explosives._

And then, there is the looming presence of RRN’s chief villain: Former U.S. President Barack Obama. Members of the deep state make a [warped pledge](https://realrawnews.com/2024/04/state-department-officials-pledge-allegiance-to-ukraine-and-obama/) of allegiance to “The United States of Ukraine” and to “one world under Obama.” Other arms of the deep state might be taken down, but Obama himself always lurks in the shadows, controlling and commanding. The occasional attempt to take him down runs into the [kind of problems](https://realrawnews.com/2023/10/special-forces-unalive-obama-clone/) you’d expect:

> _“Why?” Obama gurgled and died._
> 
> _Inexplicably, the body spontaneously combusted, starting at both hands and spreading to the arms and chest. Special Forces tried extinguishing the flames with sand and water, but their efforts were in vain—the flames were rapidly charring burnt flesh._
> 
> _“Check his feet,” the Special Forces lead, who had been trained to spot body doubles and clones, called out._
> 
> _They swiftly yanked off Obama’s socks and sneakers and saw he had flat feet, and that his sneakers had been augmented to fit people with fallen arches. They pulled down his pants; Obama had no genitals, a telltale indicator of cloning._
> 
> _The body became too hot to touch and was soon consumed by fire._

Like Bob Ross, Michael Baxter has no mistakes, only happy little accidents. In late 2021, RRN reported on the [conviction](https://realrawnews.com/2021/11/military-convicts-marc-mezvinsky/) of the late Chelsea Clinton’s husband, Marc Mezvinsky. Being only a lackey in the Clintons’ plot to abduct children and sell them on the black market, Mezvinsky received a comparatively lenient life sentence. But wait! Two months later, Gitmo’s chaplain mentioned in passing that he had attended Mezvinsky’s execution. Eagle-eyed readers saw the discrepancy and cried foul. But Baxter didn’t miss a beat.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc5e8197-f02d-4221-9186-4bcc4f165c72_759x723.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc5e8197-f02d-4221-9186-4bcc4f165c72_759x723.png)

When Baxter reported on the [arrest](https://realrawnews.com/2022/04/military-arrests-david-axelrod/) of former Obama adviser David Axelrod, only to publish no follow-up, he had a ready explanation a year later: Axelrod had been executed without trial by being [thrown out of an airplane](https://realrawnews.com/2023/07/the-untried-and-the-dead-david-axelrod/), and it took months for Baxter to learn the truth.

I’ll admit, I find Baxter’s efforts to maintain narrative integrity incredibly charming, given how the clash with the latent absurdity of the whole endeavor. Like most fictional universes, the Real Raw Newsiverse crumbles if you think about it too hard. If there are White Hat and Black Hat partitions of the military, how does military procurement work? How do newly-enlisted personnel know which faction they are joining? Do the two factions have separate recruiters? And when literally everyone carries a basic video camera in their pocket, and social media access is universal, how are major battles being fought on American soil with zero video evidence anywhere?

At the meta level, the entire construct gets even sillier. The conceit of the site is that Trump has _secretly_ left power to entrap his foes…yet then his allies go and blab the entire “real” story to an online blog. The cover for this is that the masses simply don’t believe it, but you know who would _definitely_ know whether the blog is accurate? The Deep State! Yet despite this, in RRN lore sinister actors from Andrew Cuomo to Oprah are always caught off guard when Delta Force[^7] smashes down their door and zip-ties their hands for a one-way trip to Cuba. 

#### Okay, But So What?

You might be tempted to think this is all irrelevant rambling into the void. But if you think that, you’re mistaken. The thing is, Real Raw News is popular. _Really_ popular. It got [more than 2 million page visits](https://www.similarweb.com/website/realrawnews.com/#traffic) in January. It’s a lot more popular than [this blog](https://www.similarweb.com/website/astralcodexten.substack.com/#traffic) and even outdraws some established publications like [The Nation.](https://www.similarweb.com/website/thenation.com/#traffic)

_“Okay, views are views, but does anyone really_ believe _this?”_ you may ask, perhaps derisively. Well, it falls to me to say that yes, yes they do. 

The typical RRN article gets hundreds upon hundreds of comments. And sure, a lot of them are “My mother is being paid $2,000/day working from home” spam, but most of them are not. Hundreds upon hundreds of comments are from readers grateful to Baxter for sharing the “truth.” Even more unsettling are comments from people who spot a problem with the occasional story, but still trust Baxter overall.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66137a9b-260a-4cfa-adf3-c02c069dabd9_712x351.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66137a9b-260a-4cfa-adf3-c02c069dabd9_712x351.png)

Baxter has a [donation page](https://www.givesendgo.com/realrawnews2) on Christian crowdfunding site GiveSendGo. It has raised more than $210,000 and donations continue to pour in on a daily basis. Sure, some donation messages clearly indicate people who are in on the joke…but many more do not.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16499732-4a26-43a0-8cd2-9dc38d5c6ac5_971x306.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16499732-4a26-43a0-8cd2-9dc38d5c6ac5_971x306.png)

But I don’t just need to guess based on comments and donation messages. In this realm, I can appeal to personal experience. I work in the broader world of American right-of-center politics, and we encounter Real Raw News believers _constantly._ We get emails from people who confidently insist the public-facing news of the day is fake, and the truth about the events at Gitmo will soon be revealed. At public Q&A events, we’ve fielded questions from genuinely nervous and worried people, who complain about their friends losing hope and being blackpilled by the news, and want to know why there hasn’t been more effort to share what’s “really” going on. A friend of mine who served in the Trump administration has described attending parties where, when he mentioned looking for a post-admin job, he received knowing looks and wink-wink-nudge-nudge remarks from people signaling they knew what was “really” going on.

Somehow and someway, a lot of people believe or half-believe or badly want to believe this stuff. And where a lot of people do anything, there are takeaways to be found! In my three-plus years of reading all news that is both real and raw, here is what I’ve found.

#### Conspiracies Evolve Like Comic Book Lore

In his [review](/p/book-review-the-alexander-romance) of the Alexander Romance, Scott remarked that figures like Alexander the Great or Hercules were, essentially, the pre-modern versions of Batman: Stories about them are a genre, with countless different variations and stylistic choices that evolve over time, with just a few set principles guiding all of them.

The Real Raw Newsiverse, and other modern conspiracy theories, also function like comic book lore. Just like Batman, and just like Hercules, “Donald Trump” has become a genre. Fake news stories about him and his Deep State enemies have a few core premises (adrenochrome, pedophile cabals, there is a Plan and we should Trust It) but endless room for variation past that point.

Fans of comic books, soap operas, or The Simpsons might be familiar with something TVTropes calls [“comic book time.”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime) Certain facets of a fictional reality are locked in place, and with the passage of time everything else is gradually retconned to maintain the status quo.

In season 2 of the Simpsons, Homer and Marge started dating [in 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_We_Was), in Season 3 Marge becomes pregnant with Bart in 1980 (after a date watching The Empire Strikes Back), and in season 4 it’s revealed that Homer missed the Moon Landing to [listen to “Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.”](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=437396369959970) Tragically, though, The Simpsons kept going past season 10, and if Homer was 18 in 1974 that would make him eligible for a full Social Security benefit today. So in 2008, the continuity changed so that Homer was [in a Nineties grunge band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x35ETy2sbg) just before marrying Marge[^8]. The Simpsons writers have avoided rejiggering the canon since, but if they do, they’ll have to confront the fact that 30-something Homer and Marge are now millennials, and in a decade they’ll be members of Gen Z. You may live to see a Simpsons flashback episode about Homer and Marge living as hipsters in Brooklyn during the 2010s (truly, we live in cursed times.)

But the same phenomenon exists in the world of conspiracies. Instead of a consistent, elaborate canon, what we have is a few story beats with a lot of customization and the occasional retcon.

When Baxter first began posting his stories, a core part of the narrative was that Donald Trump still secretly had all the powers of the presidency and was still in command of the entire U.S. military command. Early articles promised that Trump’s apparent loss of office was only a temporary ruse, necessary to expose the worst elements of the Deep State, but that Trump’s triumphal return to power would [take place by July 4, 2021](https://realrawnews.com/2021/04/trump-inauguration-july-4-2021/). The national media might have put on a song and dance suggesting otherwise, but behind the scenes, loyal military forces were the _real_ ones in control. This control even extended to the military helpfully [house-sitting the White House](https://realrawnews.com/2021/07/u-s-military-holding-white-house-for-trumps-return/) and not letting Biden use it. 

>  _Despite his illegitimate victory, Biden met an unwelcome surprise when he arrived at the White House on January 20. Instead of getting a ceremonial greeting, he and Kamala Harris were stopped by National Guard and U.S. Marines at the barbwire fence encircling the White House. The Marines informed them that the military had assumed control of the Executive Branch and instructed them to vacate the area. When Harris belligerently said, “Move aside, we’re president now,” the Marines locked the gate._
> 
> _[…] To avoid shame and maintain an illusion of power, Biden’s people concocted a ruse, supported by his media allies, to deceive the American public into believing he had won a fair election and had moved into the White House on schedule._
> 
> _Inside Actor/Producer Tyler Perry’s 300-acre Atlanta estate sits a three-story stucco replica of the commander-in-chief’s residence, which he originally built as a set piece for a television show. […] Although the replicant White House is built to 80% scale, on television and in images it’s indistinguishable from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Biden and Harris have been using the facsimile to feign leadership and impose despotic rule on the nation._

Of course, July 4 came and went, with Trump’s return nowhere to be seen, so the canon simply updated: In the new narrative, the military had been conducting a year-long election fraud audit on Trump’s behalf, the results were nearly ready for public release, and Trump’s return would simply be [“swift.” ](https://realrawnews.com/2021/09/trump-vows-swift-return-as-military-completes-election-fraud-investigation/) But no swift return has transpired, and so as the 2024 election has approached, the lore has evolved in the direction of Trump authentically running in this election and simply reclaiming power by winning it.

As time has passed, more subtle changes have had to pile up. Early on, RRN reported that Joe Biden was a brain dead semi-corpse being held at Walter Reed, and any public appearances by “Biden” were one of several actors. But after four years of Let’s Go Brandon, Biden himself has become a more popular villain, and so quietly references to his brain-dead status have disappeared.

In the early days of RRN, the military was firmly behind Trump and any implication that Biden held the powers of commander-in-chief was a media-fueled sham. But as time has passed, Trump being the “real” commander-in-chief over a loyal military has evolved into a reality where there are two American militaries, a “White Hat” faction loyal to Trump and “Black Hats” loyal to Biden. Early stories implied the White Hats were more numerous, but recent stories have implied the opposite, with the White Hats an elite force that often wins battles decisively while badly outnumbered. A secret purge has gradually become a secret [civil war](https://realrawnews.com/2023/10/marines-push-fema-out-of-maui/), specifically one with frequent war crimes:

> _White Hat forces in Maui have eradicated or repelled all but a handful of the felonious FEMA agents who began terrorizing the tropical paradise in the aftermath of the inexplicable blaze that razed Lahaina and surrounding towns in early August, a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News._
> 
> _Since mid-August, United States Marines have fought with FEMA patrols in Lahaina, Kaanapali, Wailuku, Maalaea, and Pukalani, and the skirmishes resulted in the deaths of approximately 475 federal goons and, alas, 34 valiant Marines. The Marines died upholding the Constitution of the United States; the feds died trying to defend the criminal Biden regime._
> 
> _[…] “The Marines died valorously,” our source said. “We ain’t taking FEMA prisoners from the rank and file, only the key players. General Smith made it clear it’s weapons-free. Those bastards know damn well they’re following unlawful orders, and they’ll pay the price.”_

I think the ever-evolving nature of conspiracies is actually pretty important to psychologically grasping their appeal. I have a friend who is a big believer in 9/11 Trutherism. He once compelled me to watch the documentary “The New Pearl Harbor,” an exhausting 5-hour film promoting 9/11 conspiracies. If one actually watches, one quickly discovers that a lot of 9/11 conspiracy theories are mutually exclusive, or at least don’t mesh well together: One conspiracy argues that fighter jets were intentionally diverted the wrong direction to keep them from shooting down the hijacked jets approaching New York, while another conspiracy suggests that United 93 was shot down, and it was all covered up. In some versions, the planes didn’t hit the Twin Towers at all. Sometimes Bush did it, and sometimes Israel did it, and so on. 

Similarly, in my career I’ve worked adjacent to people who, like RRN, were _very_ hostile to Covid-19 shots. That hostility made them sequentially endorse wildly different assertions about how the vaccines worked. Sometimes, the vaccines contain heavy metals. Sometimes, they contain hydra DNA to turn recipients into partially non-human chimeras. Sometimes, the vaccines are a depopulation agent. Sometimes, they’re a mind-control agent, or a killswitch that can be activated by self-assembling nanomachinery. One viral documentary in 2022 claimed that Covid was caused by [snake venom in the water supply](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/radio-host-stew-peters-watch-the-water-film-ridiculously-claims-covid-19-is-snake-venom/), and that Covid vaccines were an additional dose of snake venom to keep people sick (all this, of course, because the snake is Satan’s animal). 

What stands out isn’t the silliness of these particular theories, but that I saw them sequentially endorsed by the _same people._

Some of these people are smart enough to notice inconsistencies, at least when they’re pointed out, so why don’t they bother them? To some extent, I think it’s for the same reason people don’t care that every Batman story doesn’t perfectly line up. Consistency isn’t the point! What actually matters is enjoying individual stories and the wider genre they fit into. Covid vaccine haters don’t think too hard about any specific story. Instead, they’re driven by a core impulse of “distrust the new vaccine that people I distrust are promoting,” and _every_ conceivably story or tale that feeds that genre of thought is, for them, worthwhile.

Similarly, Real Raw News fans don’t think too hard about any specific story. Instead, I think their core impulse is, ironically, profound disappointment in how the Trump administration failed to deliver. Trump shook up the American political landscape more than anyone in living memory, and promised sweeping changes to every level of American government, yet his actual administration proved rather disorderly, changed far less than was promised, and then lost power after one term. For many, this simply prompted a revision in how they saw Trump. But for others, the preferred response is to embrace a fantasy reality where Trump is a superhero.

I actually think the reverse side of this explains things like the durability of Russiagate: If you’re a normal American liberal, everything Trump says is offensive and piggish, but to justify their level of disdain for them, many needed to elevate his evil to the level of treason, even if that never really made any sense. It can't just be that Trump is an egotistical jerk or a narcissist or whatever. He's got to be a traitor who's going to end American democracy.

#### People Crave Extreme, Over-the-Top, and Underhanded Solutions.

At the height of the French Revolution’s Reign of Terror, the Committee of Public Safety pushed through the [Law of 22 Prairial](https://revolution.chnm.org/d/439/). The law simplified the procedures of the country’s Revolutionary Tribunal by:

  * Defining a whole heap of activities as criminal treason, including “creating scarcity,” disparaging the National Convention, “inspiring discouragement,” and spreading fake news. 



  * Capping trials at three days in length.

  * Abolishing defense counsel.

  * Abolishing all witnesses, if “moral proofs” against the accused make such witnesses unnecessary.

  * Making the sentence for all crimes identical: Mandatory death penalty[^9].




As far as perfidious methods to deliberately destroy due process and engineer mass executions go, the Law of 22 Prairial is pretty much unmatched in human history. And yet: In the roughly two months of the law’s existence, about one-fifth of defendants were still acquitted! 

No such good fortune exists in Gitmo. The White Hats’ secret tribunal is a tribunal of blood. In three years of activity, as far as I know exactly one person has escaped conviction: Former Attorney General [Jeff Sessions](https://realrawnews.com/2023/06/jag-frees-jeff-sessions-drops-all-charges/), freed after a direct intervention from Trump. A tiny handful of others have received decades-long prison sentences, but even they tend to meet bad ends. Bill Clinton [received a life sentence](https://realrawnews.com/2021/06/military-tribunal-convicts-bill-clinton/), only to mysteriously [die in prison](https://realrawnews.com/2021/09/bill-clinton-dead-at-gitmo/), perhaps murdered by his daughter Chelsea, who wasn’t really his daughter, but nevertheless soon wound up [executed herself](https://realrawnews.com/2021/11/chelsea-clinton-hanged-at-gitmo/). 

Not only does the rate of death sentences at Gitmo seem to exceed 90 percent, Baxter makes very little effort to portray the proceedings as fair or just. Upon arrest, instead of being read their rights, detainees are informed that they have _no_ rights, and are instead “enemy combatants.” Yet despite being classified as “enemy combatants,” defendants are almost without exception charged with treason. The U.S. Constitution defines treason narrowly as levying war against the United States, or giving aid and comfort to its enemies, and requires at least two witnesses to the same specific act, but in Gitmo the label is invoked with a liberality that would make Robespierre blush. “Traitors” have been arrested and convicted for [telling troops not to attend Trump rallies](https://realrawnews.com/2023/11/marines-arrest-treasonous-air-force-colonel-in-north-dakota/) and for [ruling against Donald Trump in court](https://realrawnews.com/2024/04/jag-arrests-deep-state-georgia-judge/).

Defense attorneys are denied access to evidence pre-trial, and many defendants get no lawyers at all. Trials work a lot like Phoenix Wright, in that at any point the three-officer panel[^10] can simply declare they’ve seen enough evidence and pronounce a conviction with death sentence immediately. In the case of former Tom Hanks co-star, this has happened [within five minutes.](https://realrawnews.com/2021/10/hanks-former-co-star-peter-scolari-executed-by-military/) Appeals are non-existent. The actual executions sometimes involve [tormenting ](https://realrawnews.com/2023/06/gretchen-whitmer-hanged-at-gitmo/)the condemned with fake escape attempts or pardons:

> _The driver told Whitmer he needed to make a pitstop to grab her “exoneration paperwork.”_
> 
>  _Then Whitmer saw the clearing and the gallows and Vice Adm. Crandall._
> 
> _And the hangman and a Navy chaplain standing atop the gallows._
> 
> _“You lied to me,” Whitmer bellowed._
> 
> _“Minor error, not a lie,” the driver replied._
> 
> _[…] The admiral instructed the hangman to flip the switch, and a second later, Whitmer was swinging from the rope, a guttural gurgling sound escaping her lips._
> 
> _She was officially pronounced dead several minutes later._
> 
> _“Another Covid queen out of the way,” Adm. Crandall said._

During the treason trial of Hillary Clinton crucial evidence is provided by former campaign manager John Podesta, who accepts a plea deal for life in prison in return for testifying about Clinton’s child-trafficking activities. But after Clinton had safely been hanged, the military tribunal simply decided to revoke Podesta’s plea deal because, well, they felt like it. 

>  _“Even though he’s not prosecuting Podesta’s case, Vice Adm. John G. Hannink made the decision to renege on the deal. He’s the one who offered it. The severity of Podesta’s crimes matched Clinton’s—a lot of stuff they did in tandem, together. When you think about it, there’s really no reason why he should get special treatment. He’s a sodomist [sic.]_[^11] _. Before breaking the deal, he called Trump,” our source said._
> 
> _But Trump, our source noted, recused himself from the decision-making process, as he didn’t want his personal feelings of the defendant to interfere with military justice. […] “If the court wants him to hang, let him hang,” Trump reportedly said._

As it happens, John Podesta was actually executed by [firing squad](https://realrawnews.com/2021/06/john-podesta-executed-at-gitmo/). 

But hey, at least he got a trial. Sometimes, particularly evil members of the Deep State are simply beaten to death in their cells, or [thrown overboard](https://realrawnews.com/2023/05/deep-staters-headed-to-guam-thrown-overboard-for-inciting-insurrection/) _._

The figure of Vladimir Putin is also a vessel for fans’ darker desires. Trump and his American allies, being properly heroic, at least take down their foes gradually. Putin’s Russians, on the other hand, live up to movie stereotypes.

> _The Army … pulled the condemned from their cells 25 at a time, binding the criminals to logs staked in the ground and blindfolding them. They had received no trials, last meals, Last Rites, or final words. A firing squad taught them the consequences of vaccine adherence._
> 
> _The Army didn’t bother removing the corpses before lining up the next 25; they simply let the dead bodies flop to the ground and forced the next group to witness the ineluctable fate awaiting them, the outcome of their insouciance_[^12] _._

What to make of all this? Honestly, I’m not entirely sure, and the takeaway might simply be “Michael Baxter needs to mix it up to keep the site interesting.” It might also speak to the bewildering complexity of modern life and the desire for something simpler and more cinematic. As people sometimes complain, [Nothing Ever Happens](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nothing-ever-happens). But on RRN, the Happening is relentless and constant. The normal legal system is aggravatingly glacial, taking years to resolve cases and often imposing meager sentences when a case finally concludes. Most of one’s political enemies, even if they lose an election, simply lateral to a high-paying private sector job or at worst fade into obscurity. But in a real, raw legal system, evil is sniffed out with much greater alacrity; the bad people are so obvious and their crimes so glaring that they can be taken out extrajudicially with no worry about a miscarriage of justice. The apparently-complex conspiracy cinematic universes is actually appealing because it makes the world far, far simpler. The bad people are all maximally bad, deserving of hastily-dispensed maximum justice.

Some of this is worrisome, too: If thousands of relatively ordinary people are willing to believe in ad-hoc military tribunals executing people with minimal due process for crimes like “ruling against Donald Trump in court,” that could be a sign that modern constitutional society is a more superficial veneer than one would hope.

#### The World’s Laziest Conspiracy

One of the most striking things about both Real Raw News and the Qanon movement it spun off from is that in some ways they are _un-_ conspiracies. 

Your more traditional conspiracy, about the Rothschilds or the World Economic Forum or the Lizard People, tells you that normal political engagement is pointless, as all that really matters is confronting and defeating the hidden forces manipulating or controlling events. 

But RRN is a conspiracy theory that calls for _total inaction._ RRN believers don’t need to raise money or write letters to the editor or join political activism groups or even _vote._ The only thing expected of an adherent is to “trust the plan.” They aren’t even waiting for a promised future deliverance. Deliverance is, in fact, happening right now – merely off-screen. 

It’s actually funny to me that the (official) press freaks out so much about Qanon, and its potential to inspire violence. Qanon and RRN tell the public that whatever has them down and depressed shouldn’t, because it’s all fake, and there are unseen heroes protecting them in the shadows. Don’t worry, just have faith and know things will work out. Real Raw News is the opiate of the digital masses. Real Raw News is the exact sort of conspiracy theory that the Deep State, if it exists, should _want_ to exist and be popular. It’s the sort of conspiracy that the Deep State, if it exists, might deliberately _invent._

Do I think that’s what happened here? Not at all – Real Raw News is way too much work for a government employee. 

#### Trump Will Never Die

But what about five years from now? What if there were some technological change that would make it far, far easier to produce evidence of a sweeping conspiracy theory?

That’s right, this review is actually about AI[^13]. 

The rise of realistic artificial intelligence has created a lot of fretting about deepfakes, and it’s also created a lot of fretting about porn. Will young men really bother with the pain and difficulty and awkwardness of dating in real life, when they can just create a custom AI girlfriend to their exact specifications, then simulate sex with her using virtual reality? Will women bother with seeking out a boyfriend if they can use an LLM to give them perfect 24/7 empathy and emotional validation?

Questions of sex and relationships are converging on Robert Nozick’s [experience machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine) – will people still seek the real thing if artificial substitutes are increasingly realistic as alternatives?

But for some reason, nobody is asking this about the news. Oh, sure, people have fretted that a deepfake video might smear a person’s reputation or swing an election. But as the AI revolution continues, a lot more becomes possible. 

Remember in 2022, when a homeless guy broke into Nancy Pelosi’s home and attacked her husband with a hammer? For a while, conspiracies flourished that Paul Pelosi was actually having some kind of erotic tryst with his attacker, and that police body camera footage might confirm this. The footage came out and, of course, offered no evidence of this.

But now imagine a world where, on Twitter, an anonymous source claims that they have the _real_ body camera footage, and it _does_ show that Paul Pelosi was having a lovers’ quarrel with his attacker. The other, mundane footage is a deepfake, released by police to cover things up, or invented from scratch by the press or the Democratic Party or both working together. 

In this world, how many people end up believing fabricated proof of Paul Pelosi’s gay lover? And before you dismiss this as all totally ridiculous, remember that lots of people believed this story with _no evidence at all_.

Many thousands of people have deluded themselves into thinking that Real Raw News is true simply because they badly want it to be true. It indulges their personal political beliefs, affirms the just-world fallacy, and lets them feel as though they possess “secret” knowledge of the world, simply by reading a blog nobody else takes seriously. 

But in a sense, _all_ of us have a little of the Real Raw News believer in us. We’re prone to confirmation bias – we like reading stories and studies that confirm our pre-held beliefs, and we’re more likely to avoid or ignore those that don’t. Sometimes, we get too excited and fall for stories that are misleading, or out of context, or dishonestly presented. Sometimes, we have radically different interpretations of the _same event_ caught on camera. Even if we know the world isn’t fair, we relish stories that let us pretend otherwise. 

So…how are those biases going to work when anyone can quickly create hyper-realistic looking “proof” for _any_ story? Already, AI-fabricated images and videos are enough to bamboozle your mom on Facebook. Soon, they might be realistic enough to fool everybody without special training, and eventually they might be so realistic they can fool just about anyone. Right now, Real Raw News is a simplistic WordPress site that uses stock photos for its imagery. But with us approaching a future where intelligence itself is too cheap to meter, we may not be far from a world where every story, however preposterous, can have a convincing 4k video of it happening. Donald Trump can be president forever, with all the evidence one could ever want. Every day of Hillary Clinton’s military tribunal will have a full day of court footage, plus a condensed highlight reel for the people who want to skip boring legal procedure. Every Marine/FEMA battle in Maui will have authentic-looking combat footage. Every Gitmo execution will be proven through “leaked” bootleg recordings of gallows and firing squads. 

Imagine you are an ordinary, mildly engaged American citizen. You live far from the halls of power, you work an ordinary job, and whatever your feelings on political issues, you rarely see elections translate in a clear way to your own daily life. You might be interested in Washington, but Washington really isn’t that interested in you. 

Online, the world throws a million potential narratives at you. In some of them, the world is a confusing mess of moral gray areas. In others, the people you care about are winning. But in some narratives, you’re the hero, the people you like do good things, and the bad guys get what they deserve. The superficial evidence for all of these narratives is about equally convincing, at a glance. Look outside, and it’s hard to see the impact of any of the stories. Your entire understanding of reality is mediated through what sites you choose to read and what videos you choose to watch. As a politically marginal person, it won’t matter what you as an individual choose to believe. 

So, what happens if you choose to believe the story you find most enjoyable? And what if millions of others choose the same?

[^1]: “Wait a minute, this is about a fake news website? Why is it in this contest?”

Excellent question! To that, I offer several answers:

  1. A collection of fake news blog posts may as well be considered a long-running series of short stories, and I hope that we’d be allowed to review the collected short stories of an author even if they were never technically compiled into a book.

  2. Scott told us to be less conventional in our choices. 

  3. I am a liberal arts graduate and I’m definitely not going to make the finals reviewing some nerdy non-fiction book.
