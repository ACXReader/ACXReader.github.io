This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** This is your last chance to take [the 2024 ACX Survey](/p/take-the-2024-acx-survey). I will close submissions Wednesday.

**2:** ACX meetups this coming week in Haifa, St. Petersburg, LA, Toronto, Vancouver, Mexico City, San Jose, Milwaukee, Hong Kong, Tallinn, Cambridge MA, Mumbai, Singapore, and many more. [See the Meetups List for details](/p/spring-meetups-everywhere-2024).

**3:** The Less Wrong team is hosting a conference/festival for the rationalist and rationalist-adjacent blogosphere, [Less Online](http://less.online/), the weekend before Manifest. Berkeley CA, 5/31 - 6/2, $400 per ticket, some housing and childcare available. I’ll be there.

**4:** The hedge fund Bridgewater [is running a forecasting contest on Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/). US residents only, extra prizes for undergraduates. Prizes include $25,000 and potentially getting recruited by Bridgewater (in which case read the “Corporate Culture” section on their wiki page before accepting).
