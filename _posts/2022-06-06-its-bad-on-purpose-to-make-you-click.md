As you travel the twists of Twitter  
As you pass through the Lands of Zuck  
And the frogs and the pinks overwhelm you with links  
And the links overwhelmingly suck  
When the Redditors ask if you've read it  
When the TikTokkers talk and tic  
Hold this admonition close to your breast:  
 _It's bad on purpose to make you click._

No actual person believes it  
It isn't a national trend  
Some loony in Maine with a turd for a brain  
Said some idiot thing, the end  
Some intern from Williams or Amherst  
Wrote all of it up, real slick  
And now it's the front page of WaPo  
 _But it's bad on purpose to make you click._

Some galaxy-brainer in Brooklyn  
Says that kids should be thrown in a bog  
Or that you've "revealed your white privilege"  
If you don't let them murder your dog  
Or that liking cats makes you a Nazi  
Or that reading books makes you a dick  
Or that sunsets are transphobic  
 _It's bad on purpose to make you click._

If you shoot back a twelve-page rebuttal  
With an indexed list of their lies  
They'll laugh like demented hyenas  
As engagement metrics rise  
If you even admit their existence  
Then you're falling for their trick  
Let them rot in their lair as you starve them of air  
 _It's bad on purpose to make you click._

This invincible mantra will banish  
All the demons of Mara and Baal  
When spoken, all troubles vanish  
When thought, all sorrows fall  
It's a sword that cuts through illusion  
And burns it to the quick  
Inscribe it upon your forehead:  
 _It's bad on purpose to make you click._
