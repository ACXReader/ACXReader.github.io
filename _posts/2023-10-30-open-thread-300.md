This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

 **1:** I’m working on another round of ACX Grants. My current plan is to use mid-5 to low-6 figures of my own money but also solicit extra funding from others. If you might be interested in donating a large amount (≥ $50K) please email me at scott@slatestarcodex.com so I can answer any questions you might have and get a sense of how much interest there is.

 **2:** Speaking of ACX Grants, one of last round’s grants went to Lars Doucet and Will Jarvis to research Georgist land value taxes; they later started the company [ValueBase](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/valuebase-backed-by-sam-altmans-hydrazine-raises-1-6-million-seed-round/). Now they’re trying to coordinate support for a potential upcoming [land value tax in Detroit](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/detroit-wants-to-be-the-first-big-american-city-to-tax-land-value). If you live in Michigan and want to help, they want to talk to you about the best ways to contact your state representative. Please get in touch with them [via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeAoTzWNhQzSWvGuvNZQbGcjgCS-LWkRHnSAnqOs79n6JQXMQ/viewform).

 **3:** Speaking of Lars, he wants to thank those of you who answered his request to pray for a sick family member last week. He says “the person in question is now in God’s hands”.
