This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** Based on your ratings, I’ve selected twelve finalists for the Book Review Contest, and will be posting one every Friday from now until July.

**2:** Comment of the week is [hiddenhare on UX](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/uigvzb/why_do_people_prefer_my_old_blogs_layout_to/i7cl10p/) (and the thread below). But also, [Vim](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-do-people-prefer-my-old-blogs/comment/6403268):

> 3D video games are running enough math to compute and draw an entire three-dimensional world with tens of millions of triangles and complex interacting physics, and they're doing it SIXTY TIMES EVERY SECOND (at least! More than twice that if you're using a 144Hz monitor). That is, they're doing it once every ~16.67 miliseconds. (6.95ms at 144 frames per second). Consider that fact, next time you open some boring 2D software on your computer and it takes a couple _seconds_ to load a dozen flat buttons and images, and then you click on a menu and it inexplicably hitches for a few _hundred milliseconds_.

This is a pretty striking observation and I’m interested in hearing people’s thoughts on what’s up.
