This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** Thanks to everyone who came to the Berkeley meetup yesterday (~125 people!) and especially to the organizers (Mingyuan, Miranda, Ruby, Oli, sorry if I’m forgetting anyone). Here’s [a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/566160007909175/) if you want to stay in touch about future Bay Area meetups. And I have some updates to conversations I had with people yesterday which I put in [a comment](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-187/comments#comment-2729763) below.

**2:** Since the last post, meetups have been added in Bangalore, Tokyo, and Ife (Nigeria), and a lot of existing meetups have changed times/dates/places, so please [check the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSMKpBkT5y4yOIcUYqKGzuyZ7jdZTKSrp-bASqY6Y5VV0ta6_hNwVWWMI2wQDzj21TaA4lMS-KSio/pubhtml) to make sure the last thing you read about meetups is still up to date.

**3:** If you’re an organizer, Mingyuan will probably be sending you a survey sometime after your meetup date. It will ask how many people came to your meetup, so please try to get a rough count.

**4:**
