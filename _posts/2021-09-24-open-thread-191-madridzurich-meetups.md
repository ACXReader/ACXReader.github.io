This is the weekly visible open thread. Odd-numbered open threads will be no-politics, even-numbered threads will be politics-allowed. This one is odd-numbered, so be careful. Otherwise, post about anything else you want. Also:

**1:** Madrid meetup this Saturday, September 25, 11 AM, at [picture.proceeds.turned](https://what3words.com/picture.proceeds.turned), aka Teatro de Titeres at El Retiro Park.

**2:** And Zurich meetup this Sunday, September 26, 5 PM, at [paints.shows.dressy](https://what3words.com/paints.shows.dressy), aka the Blatterwiese. Please feel free to come to either of these even if you feel awkward about it, even if you’re not “the typical ACX reader”, even if you’re worried people won’t like you, etc, etc, etc. And if you’re somewhere else, check [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSMKpBkT5y4yOIcUYqKGzuyZ7jdZTKSrp-bASqY6Y5VV0ta6_hNwVWWMI2wQDzj21TaA4lMS-KSio/pubhtml) to find the closest meetup to you.
