Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for ACX meetup organizers. Volunteers have arranged meetups in 183 cities around the world, from Baghdad to Bangalore to Buenos Aires.

You can find the list below, in the following order:

  1. Africa & Middle East

  2. Asia-Pacific

  3. Europe

  4. North America

  5. South America




You can see a map of all the events on [the LessWrong community page](https://www.lesswrong.com/community). You can also see a searchable sheet at this [Airtable link](https://airtable.com/appEBNqFVvAGqyOeJ/shrU2yUQYPpjL1ZbF/tblZXwcGfvBges9Eq).

Within each region, it’s alphabetized first by country, then by city. For instance, the first entry in Europe is Vienna, **A** ustria, and the first entry for Germany is **B** erlin. Each region and country has its own header. The USA is the exception where it is additionally sorted by state, with states having their own subheaders. Hopefully this is clear. You can also just have your web browser search for your city by pressing ctrl+f and typing it if you’re on Windows, or command+f and typing if you’re on Mac. If you’re on Linux, I assume you can figure this out.

Scott will provisionally be attending the meetup in Berkeley. ACX meetups coordinator Skyler will provisionally be attending Boston, Cavendish, Burlington, Berlin, Bremen, Amsterdam, Cardiff, London, and Berkeley. Some of the biggest ones might be announced on the blog, regardless of whether or not Scott or Skyler attends.

**Extra Info For Potential Attendees**

**1.** If you’re reading this, you’re invited. Please don’t feel like you “won’t be welcome” just because you’re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, don’t want to buy anything at the cafe or restaurant where it’s held, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You’ll be fine!   
**2**. You don’t have to RSVP or contact the organizer to be able to attend (unless the event description says otherwise); RSVPs are mostly to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up, and let them tell you if there are last-second changes. I’ve also given email addresses for all organizers in case you have a question.

**Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:  
  
1.** If you’re the host, bring a sign that says “ACX MEETUP” and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).  
**2.** Bring blank labels and pens for nametags.  
**3.** Have people type their name and email address in a spreadsheet or in a Google Form (accessed via a bit.ly link or QR code), so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.  
**4.** If it’s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and if you try to organize some kind of “fun” “event” it’ll probably just be annoying.  
**5.** It’s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you’re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.  
**6.** In case people want to get to know each other better outside the meetup, you might want to mention [reciprocity.io](https://www.reciprocity.io/), the rationalist friend-finder/dating site.  
**7.** If you didn’t make a LessWrong event for your meetup (or if you did but Skyler didn’t know about it) the LessWrong team did it for you using the email address you gave here. To claim your event, log into LW (or create an account) using that email address, or message the LW team on Intercom (chat button in the bottom right corner of lesswrong.com).

If you need to change a meetup date or you have any other questions, please email skyler[at]rationalitymeetups[dot]org.
