This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Due to changing plans, I might not be able to make it to [Manifest](https://www.manifestconference.net/), currently less than 50-50 chance, sorry if you were hoping to see me there.

**2:** Iâ€™m traveling and might be even worse at responding to emails than usual for a while.
