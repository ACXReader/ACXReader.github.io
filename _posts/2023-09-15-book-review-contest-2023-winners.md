  * _**[Njal’s Saga](/p/your-book-review-njals-saga)**_ , reviewed by Scott Alexander. This one got the most votes, but I’m disqualifying it because it seems in poor taste for me to win my own contest.

I’m also giving out seven Honorable Mentions. These either came very close to making the finals, or had an interesting balance of very high and very low votes in the first round, or I just personally liked them. They are:

  * _**[Don’t Sleep, There Are Snakes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CiEI7aDL2bMIdx7yayy3vlq0TJ8dO5LGnG7yIDPiw8/edit#heading=h.aoaw49ve7clq)**_ by Julian. He’s a professional translator and doesn’t blog or substack or anything of the sort, but will happily reply to [e-mails](mailto:julian@fastmail.cn).

  * _**[The Making of Prince of Persia](https://awweide.substack.com/p/the-making-of-prince-of-persia)**_ , reviewed by Aksel W. W. Eide. He is a machine learning researcher who spends too much time overanalyzing stories, subcultures and deckbuilding games. He has [a mini-Substack](https://awweide.substack.com/) with the review and [a rant about what makes Civilization 6 so annoying](https://awweide.substack.com/p/civilization-6-and-choices-choices).

  * _**[Science Fictions](https://michael-zhang.medium.com/trust-scientists-less-trust-humanity-more-9eb1f5af98d4)**_ , reviewed by Michael Zhang. He is an astrophysicist [researching exoplanet atmospheres](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/hubble-puffy-planets-lose-atmospheres-become-super-earths/). His blog, which includes the book review, is [on Medium](https://michael-zhang.medium.com/). He is happy to discuss the review in the comments, or to discuss astronomy at mzz hang 2014 at gmail dot com.

  * _**[Simulacra](https://captiveliberty.substack.com/p/the-simulacra-by-philip-k-dick)**_ , reviewed by Matthew Pagan. He is an infrastructure engineer who publishes poetry and short fiction to his Substack [Captive Liberty](https://captiveliberty.substack.com). He occasionally produces AI-read audiobooks of public domain literature (or of literature from which he has received publisher permission); he uploads these mp3 files under a Creative Commons license to his website [Logos Audio](https://logos.audio).

  * _**[The Design Of Everyday Things](https://ninedimensions.substack.com/p/book-review-the-design-of-everyday)**_ , by NineDimensions. He is a game developer from Australia who writes short, silly fiction at [A Strange Dream](https://astrangedream.substack.com) and is venturing into blogging at [Nine Dimensions](https://ninedimensions.substack.com).

  * _**[How To Talk About Books You Haven’t Read](https://falliblepieces.substack.com/p/book-review-how-to-talk-about-books)**_**,** reviewed by Cam Peters. Cam is a data analyst who blogs at [Fallible Pieces](https://falliblepieces.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile&utm_source=%2Fprofile%2F12769514-cam-peters&utm_medium=reader2) and tweets at [@campeters4](https://twitter.com/campeters4). He also won an honorable mention last year for [his review of The Beginning Of Infinity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/100kMdSVFviZSSBvUyyEQPMNlvLptVQxHFD9i9wGuBWs/edit#heading=h.c9ry6h2ze0xi).

  * _**The Alexander Romance**_ , reviewed by Scott Alexander. I worried people would [figure out which review was mine](https://manifold.markets/ShakedKoplewitz/did-scott-write-the-njals-saga-book), so to make it harder I entered twice. Alexander Romance was my second entry. It placed 37th, nowhere near high enough to make the finals. I hope this is encouraging for anyone else who didn’t make the finals - apparently there’s a lot of variance even among reviews by the same person! I still liked this one and will probably put it up as a normal post here soon.




Some extra praise: _Man's Search For Meaning_ placed 4th; I thought it was a good review of an important book by someone who's clearly thought about these issues a lot. I loved _Public Citizen_ ; I had a vague sense that a lot of government happens by lawsuit now and it hadn't always been this way, but I wouldn't have even known where to start in figuring out why and how this happened, and I had always thought of Nader as "that car guy who everyone mysteriously thought was important who then lost the 2000 election", so I'm glad to get more clarity there. _Zuozhuan_ was oddly haunting and I will remember the part about Zichan and the law code for a long time. _Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes_ was a discussion of the Piraha (the weird tribe that doesn't seem to have supposedly universal features of language and culture) which gave a great sense of how it might feel to be a primitive rainforest tribe.

All winners and finalists get a free ACX subscription at the email I have on record for them. I haven’t done this yet but I will next week. All winners and finalists also get the right to pitch me essays they want me to put up on ACX (warning that I am terrible to pitch to, reject most things without giving good reasons, and am generally described as awful to work with - but you can do it if you want! If I choose to publish your article, I will give you some fair amount of money we can negotiate at the time, probably around $1K). All winners and finalists get the opportunity to be named and honored publicly here; if I didn’t include your details, it’s because I didn’t get your response to my email asking me what details to include, and if you want to change that you should send me an email so I can name you in an open thread or something.

If you want to know how you did in the preliminaries, I’ve put the scores of all entries up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1amWl-Khz3LYlfZp9DUl7b4V0ySg3jOz1/edit#gid=1624610629). Column A is average score, Column B is average score if you add some dummy reviews to adjust for the less-reviewed ones having more variance. Notice the small sample size and don’t take it too seriously!

I’m planning another contest next year. I haven’t decided if it will be book review or generic essay. I’ll post more information sometime around January and demand final submissions sometime like April/May.

Thanks again to everyone who made this possible, including a_reader (who collected all the reviews into readable documents), AlexanderTheGrand (who implemented the runoff voting), everyone who voted, and of course the 156 people who entered.
