This is the trimonthly (?) classifieds thread. Advertise whatever you want in the comments.

We’re going to try keeping it organized again, so please respond to the appropriate top-level comment:**Employment, Dating, Read My Blog**(also includes podcasts, books, etc)**, Consume My Product/Service, Meetup,** or **Other.** I’ll delete anything that’s not in the appropriate category.

Remember that posting dating ads is hard and scary. Please refrain from commenting too negatively on anyone’s value as a human being. I’ll be much less strict about employers, bloggers, etc.

And here are some extra dating profiles of people I know of and like:

[Cody](http://www.tinyurl.com/datecody) (29 / F / Bay Area)  
[Clara](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIl3nCF5-9Oo69XEbsBD7wpfnW7lH8KbSg7mS1zBIN8/edit) (26 / F / Bay Area)
