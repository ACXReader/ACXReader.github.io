Seven years ago, I wrote an online serial novel, _Unsong,_ about alternate history American kabbalists. You can read the online version [here](https://unsongbook.com/).

The online version isn’t going anywhere, but lots of people asked for a hard copy. I tried to get the book formally published, but various things went wrong and I procrastinated. Commenter Pycea finally saved me from myself and helped get it published on Amazon (thank you!) [You can now buy the book here, for $19.99](https://amzn.to/4aKmRXQ).

I think the published version is an improvement over the original. I rewrote three or four chapters I wasn’t satisfied with, and changed a few character names to be more kabbalistically appropriate. The timeline and history have been rectified, and there are more details on the 2000 - 2015 period and how UNSONG was founded. I gave the political situation a little more depth (watch for the Archon of Arkansas, the Shogun of Michigan, and the Caliph of California). And the sinister Malia Ngo has been replaced by the equally sinister, but actual-character-development-having, Ash Bentham.

All of the parts that were actually good have been kept.

Thanks to everyone for being patient, and special thanks to Pycea for making this happen.
