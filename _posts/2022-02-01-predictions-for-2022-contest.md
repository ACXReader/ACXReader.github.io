_These next two sections are based on Vox’s[22 Predictions For 2022](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22824620/predicting-midterms-covid-roe-wade-oscars-2022) and and Matt Yglesias’ predictions in his [Predictions Are Hard](https://www.slowboring.com/p/predictions-are-hard) post. In both cases, inspired by Zvi, I’ve given the original predictor’s estimate, then either stuck with it, or bought/sold to some other level. This is kind of unfair, because I get to see the original predictor’s thoughts and they don’t get to see mine - also, I’m a few weeks later than they are, and in a few cases that gives me extra knowledge. So:_

**VOX PREDICTIONS**  
1\. Democrats will lose their majorities in the House and Senate (95%): SELL TO 90%  
2\. Inflation in the US will average under three percent (80%): HOLD  
3\. Unemployment in the US will fall below four percent by November (80%): SELL to 60% if they mean _in_ November, otherwise hold  
4\. Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade (65%): SELL to 60%  
5\. Stephen Breyer will retire from the Supreme Court (55%): N/A  
6\. Emmanuel Macron will be reelected president of France (65%): HOLD  
7\. Jair Bolsonaro will be reelected president of Brazil (55%): SELL to 50%  
8\. Bongbong Marcos will be elected president of the Philippines (55%): BUY to 60%  
9\. Rebels will not capture Addis Ababa (55%): N/A  
10\. China will not reopen its borders in the first half of 2022 (80%): BUY to 90%  
11\. Chinese GDP will continue to grow for the first 3/4 of the year (95%): SELL to 90%  
12\. 20% of US kids between 0.5 and 5 years old will get at least one COVID vaccine by year's end (65%): HOLD  
13\. WHO will designate another Variant Of Concern by year's end (75%): HOLD  
14\. 12 billion COVID shots will be given out globally by 11/2022 (80%): HOLD  
15\. At least one country will have less than 10% of people vaccinated with two shots by 11/2022 (70%): BUY to 95%  
16\. A psychedelic drug will be decriminalized/legalized in at least one more US state (75%): HOLD  
17\. AI will discover a new drug promising enough for clinical trials (85%): HOLD  
18\. US govt will not renew the ban on funding gain-of-function research (60%): HOLD  
19\. The Biden administration will set the social cost of carbon at $100/ton or more (70%): HOLD  
20\. 2022 will be warmer than 2021 (80%): HOLD  
21\. Kenneth Branagh's Belfast will win Best Picture (55%): SELL to 30%  
22\. Norway will win the most medals at the 2022 Winter Olympics (60%): HOLD

 _While I agree things don’t look good for the Democrats, 95% chance they lose both houses of Congress implies 97.5% chance of losing each house, which seems too high. I’m smashing the BUY button as hard as I can on “at least one country will fail to get to 10% vaccination rate” - there are a lot of countries, and as far as I know North Korea is refusing all vaccines out of general evilness. Although I’m not supposed to check betting markets, Dylan writes that he checked the betting markets for the Academy Awards, saw a 30% chance that Belfast would win, but he thinks the number is more like 55%. I know nothing about movies, but where markets and a puny mortal disagree I’ll go with the market. I’ve rated a few options N/A because they’ve already resolved or had big updates since Vox made their predictions._

**YGLESIAS PREDICTIONS**  
1\. Democrats lose both houses of Congress (90%) HOLD  
2\. Democrats lose at least two Senate seats (80%) HOLD  
3\. Democrats lose fewer than six Senate seats (80%) HOLD  
4\. Nancy Pelosi announces retirement plans (70%) HOLD  
5\. Stephen Breyer does not retire (60%) N/A  
6\. Some version of Build Back Better passes (60%) HOLD  
7\. Joe Biden is still president (90%) HOLD  
8\. At least one Biden cabinet-rank official resigns (70%) HOLD  
9\. No military conflict between the PRC and Taiwan (a worryingly low 90%) HOLD  
10\. New U.S. sanctions on Russia (70%) HOLD  
11\. Saudi Arabia and Israel establish diplomatic relations (60%) SELL to 50%  
12\. Fewer U.S. Covid deaths in 2022 than in 2021 (80%) BUY to 90%  
13\. Emmanuel Macron re-elected (60%) HOLD  
14\. Traffic light coalition exploits loopholes to get around the constitutional debt brake (70%) HOLD  
15\. No recession in 2021 (90%) SELL to 80%

20\. Fewer U.S. Covid-19 deaths in 2022 than in 2020 (80%) BUY to 90%  
21\. Additional booster shots of mRNA vaccines authorized for seniors (80%) HOLD  
22\. November 2022 year-on-year CPI growth is below 6% (70%) BUY to 80%  
23\. November 2022 year-on-year CPI growth is above 4% (70%) SELL to 50%  
24\. The Fed ends up doing more than its currently forecast three interest rate hikes (60%) HOLD  
25\. Russia does not invade Ukraine (60%) HOLD  
26\. Viktor Orbán loses power in Hungary (60%) HOLD  
27\. Sinn Fein becomes the largest party in the Northern Ireland assembly (60%) HOLD  
28\. The U.S. and Canada reach an agreement on softwood lumber (70%) HOLD  
29\. Democrats go down at least one governor on net (60%) HOLD  
30\. The unemployment rate stays between 4 and 5% (70%) SELL to 60% if you mean 12/22, to 40% if you mean it never gets outside that range at all

 _Yglesias is mostly forecasting things he understands much better than I do, so I’m mostly holding. I’ll go hard on “fewer US COVID deaths in 2022 than previous years” because Omicron seems less deadly and there’s less “dry tinder” of unvaccinated people; I could be wrong if a non-Omicron lineage spits out a really severe new variant. I’m pretty confused by Matt predicting high inflation for next year; my understanding is the Fed and markets predict lower; I totally admit Matt knows more about inflation than I do but in order to make things interesting I’ll bet against him anyway. I’m equally confused about his prediction of a pretty narrow band of unemployment rates; if I understand right, last month was already outside his band (3.9%) and so he’s betting no future month will repeat that. Again, Matt knows more econ than I do but I’ve sold anyway._

Sam Marks and Eric Neyman have kindly turned this tradition into a contest.

If you want, you can go to [their form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QLfg4WgmOobgcw-I1eHLi8U6yxivggHH5G__3TQ4sug/viewform?edit_requested=true) and predict the same set of questions I did (minus the personal and redacted ones). Use the same rules I did: no peeking at the prediction markets, and no more than five minutes of research per question. If you don’t know anything about a question, you can leave it blank and it will get filled with my prediction by default.

The winner will get eternal glory (realistically: mentioned on an Open Thread) and a free ACX subscription.
