This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). Also:

**1:** Applications are open for [EAGxNYC](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-global/events/eagxnyc#agenda), an effective altruist conference in New York City. Whether or not youâ€™re attending the conference, there will be a public ACX meetup open to everybody right next to the conference venue (in the food court of Brookfield Place), Saturday, August 19, 4 - 7 PM.
