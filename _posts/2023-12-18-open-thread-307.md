This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Update to****[Quests and Requests](/p/quests-and-requests): Alexander Putilin, who previously took point on the EEG replication experiment, plans to apply for an ACX Grant. He wants to try crowdfunding first - I think we got wires crossed on whether you need some pre-existing work to show before applying (you don’t), but you’re welcome to look at his [campaign page ](https://gofund.me/05f7c16c)anyway. He asks that while I’m highlighting him, I also signal-boost his [prediction market dating show attempt](https://lu.ma/5j19hllg) (London, this Tuesday).

**2:** Update to [Beyond “Abolish The FDA”](/p/beyond-abolish-the-fda) \- it turns out the “experimental drug approval” category I recommended already exists. What’s the catch? It’s only for animals - see [the FDA’s veterinary site](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/resources-you/conditional-approval-explained-resource-veterinarians#company) for details. H/T [this Less Wrong post arguing that the new dog longevity drug probably doesn’t work](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vHSkxmYYqW59sySqA/the-likely-first-longevity-drug-is-based-on-sketchy-science), which is also interesting in its own right.
