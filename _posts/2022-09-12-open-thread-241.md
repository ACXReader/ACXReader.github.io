This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?). In this week’s news:

**1:** Book Review Contest winners should have received their money and subscriptions. If you think you should have, but haven’t, email me at scott@slatestarcodex.com. I haven’t received payment details for Roger or Chaostician; please email me, and if you’ve already tried emailing me please include “This is a genuine nonspam message” in your email to make sure my spam filter didn’t get it.

**2:** Worldwide ACX meetup season continues. This week there will be meetups in Sydney on Thursday, Ottawa on Friday, Cambridge (UK) / DC / San Jose / Atlanta on Saturday, and Berkeley / SF / Toronto / New Haven / Chicago on Sunday - plus many more. See [the meetups list](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/meetups-everywhere-2022-times-and) for details.

**3:** I said I’d put this on the last classifieds thread and then forgot - [Surf](https://www.imsurf.in/) is “a platform for helping people make new friends”; they’re interested in users and advice on how to make it better.
