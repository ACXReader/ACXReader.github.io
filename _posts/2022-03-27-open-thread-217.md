**1:** Remember: entries to the [2022 ACX Book Review Contest](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-contest-rules-2022?s=w) are due April 5th. You can send them in with [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18ft8ZxQcKFwMsi_DZINn7d7VIso_y1Armfr59YeOGLE/edit).

**2:** The**** effective altruists I know are really excited about [Carrick Flynn for Congress](https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/) (he’s running as a Democrat in Oregon). Carrick has fought poverty in Africa, worked on biosecurity and pandemic prevention since 2015, and is a world expert on the intersection of AI safety and public policy (see eg [this paper](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/aipolicy.pdf) he co-wrote with Nick Bostrom). He also supports normal Democratic priorities like the environment, abortion rights, and universal health care (see [here](http://issues) for longer list). See also [this endorsement](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qi9nnrmjwNbBqWbNT/the-best-usd5-800-i-ve-ever-donated-to-pandemic-prevention) from biosecurity grantmaker Andrew SB.

I’m closer to 60/45.

Although he’s getting support from some big funders, campaign finance privileges small-to-medium-sized donations from ordinary people. If you want to support him, you can see a list of possible options [here](https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/joinus) \- including [donations. ](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/flynn-web)You can donate max $2900 for the primary, plus another $2900 for the general that will be refunded if he doesn’t make it. If you do donate, it would be extra helpful if the money came in before a key reporting deadline March 31.

**3:** Every year in autumn I hold a big Meetups Everywhere event, and every time people tell me I should do it more often than once a year. So this time we’ll hold a mini-Meetups-Everywhere this April. It won’t be any different from your usual meetup schedule except that it’ll be the Schelling time for everyone who only wants to come once every few months to come. If you’re a meetups organizer (or want to become one), please [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6bVGranNA5AKTKj8l4XtTzvXBaRsap48rEvbP5gqA2JTiEQ/viewform) with the date of a meetup April 11th or later. Next Sunday I’ll put the results on the Open Thread for people to see.

**4:** Speaking of meetups, the rationalist/EA establishment is trying to promote local meetups. If you’re a local ACX/LW meetups organizer, you’re potentially invited to attend an all-expenses paid retreat in California in July with our meetups czar Mingyuan. Please read more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DVJ84uiARZQNGqmtO_6epFv6LwFdlQRVyQXoPMTgFq8/edit), then fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkmBd0akoR6mpGxzTdV_1RP43edfaTgDl7kDff9VZm8sCoPg/viewform) to get on her radar.

**5:** And speaking of Mingyuan, she is going to inspect - sorry, enjoy the hospitality of - the East Coast meetup groups. She’ll be in DC: 4/11–4/13 Baltimore: 4/14 Philadelphia: 4/15–4/16 NYC: 4/17–4/21 Yale: 4/22–4/23 Northampton: 4/24–4/25 Boston: 4/26–5/1. The local groups have already taken care of having meetups at the right time, but she’s looking for people who could host her and drive her between cities . Email meetupsmingyuan@gmail.com if you can help.

**6:** Last week I tried to figure out the needs of community members in Russia and Ukraine. There are some great resources [on the thread](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-216/comment/5638593), but issues that still need solving: 

  * [Seven Ukrainian refugees looking for remote work](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-216/comment/5662472?s=w)

  * [Ukrainian senior infra engineer normally at a FAANG but now stranded in Ukraine looking for Rust/C++ short/mid-term work/contract](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-216/comment/5641206?s=w)

**7:** On Tuesday, I posted a [response ](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/contra-hoel-on-aristocratic-tutoring?s=w)to Erik Hoel’s [post on aristocratic tutoring](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins?s=w). Since then he posted a [response to my response](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/follow-up-why-we-stopped-making-einsteins?s=r), and we’re continuing the discussion [in the comments there.](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/follow-up-why-we-stopped-making-einsteins/comment/5703529?s=r)
