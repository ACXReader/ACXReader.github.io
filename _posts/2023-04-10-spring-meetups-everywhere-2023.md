Many cities have regular Astral Codex Ten meetup groups. Twice a year, I try to advertise their upcoming meetups and make a bigger deal of it than usual so that irregular attendees can attend. This is one of those times.

This year we have spring meetups planned in over eighty cities, from Tokyo to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Thanks to all the organizers who responded to my request for details, and to Meetups Czar Skyler and the Less Wrong team for making this happen.

You can find the list below, in the following order:

  1. Africa

  2. Asia-Pacific (including Australia)

  3. Europe (including UK)

  4. Latin America

  5. North America (including Canada)




There should very shortly be a map of these meetups on[ the LessWrong community page](https://www.lesswrong.com/community).

Within each region it’s alphabetized then by city - so the first entry in Europe is **A** thens, Greece. Sorry if this is confusing.

I’ll provisionally be attending the Berkeley meetup on May 6th. Skyler will provisionally be attending Manhattan, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, and Berkeley.

 **Extra Info For Potential Attendees**

 **1.** If you’re reading this, you’re invited. Please don’t feel like you “won’t be welcome” just because you’re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You’ll be fine!  
**2**. You don’t have to RSVP or contact the organizer to be able to attend (unless the event description says otherwise); RSVPs are mostly to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up, and let them tell you if there are last-second changes. I’ve also given email addresses for all organizers in case you have a question.

 **Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:  
  
1.** If you’re the host, bring a sign that says “ACX MEETUP” and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).  
 **2.** Bring blank labels and pens for nametags.  
 **3.** Have people type their name and email address in a spreadsheet or in a Google Form (accessed via a bit.ly link or QR code), so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.  
 **4.** If it’s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and if you try to organize some kind of “fun” “event” it’ll probably just be annoying.  
 **5.** It’s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you’re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.  
 **6.** In case people want to get to know each other better outside the meetup, you might want to mention[ reciprocity.io](https://www.reciprocity.io/), the rationalist friend-finder/dating site.  
 **7.** If you didn’t make a LessWrong event for your meetup, the LessWrong team did it for you using the email address you gave here. To claim your event, log into LW (or create an account) using that email address, or message the LW team on Intercom (chat button in the bottom right corner of lesswrong.com).

If you need to change a meetup date or you have any other questions, please email skyler[at]rationalitymeetups[dot]org.

Just know that there is no organizer.)

Location: In the basement of the MaRS Discovery District Atrium, there is a food court with ample customizable seating and is friendly to loitering. I'll be there wearing a neon yellow jacket and have a small sign with "Applied Rationality Toronto" on it.. To get to the food court, enter from MaRS from University avenue. Walk until you see escalators. Go down the escalators. The food court is behind the escalators. If you are lost, ask for directions to the food court from any of the security guards.
