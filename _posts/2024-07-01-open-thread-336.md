This is the weekly visible open thread. Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. ACX has an unofficial [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTKtdut), and [bulletin board](https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php), and [in-person meetups around the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/community?filters%5B0%5D=SSC). 95% of content is free, but for the remaining 5% you can subscribe **[here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/subscribe?)**. Also:

**1:** Now I’ve also released the new version of Unsong as an ebook on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Unsong-Scott-Siskind-ebook/dp/B0D84DLKZW/) and [Gumroad](https://astralcodexten.gumroad.com/l/wbefjq?_gl=1*9x0cux*_ga*NzAzNzI3Mzg4LjE3MTk0MDUwNTI.*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTcxOTgzNTQ5Ny4yLjEuMTcxOTgzNTcxOC4wLjAuMA..), both $4.99. Yes, somehow the Amazon hardcopy is my pen name and the ebook is my real name, probably I made a mistake, probably I’ll get it corrected soon.

**2:** New [subscriber only post, ](/p/subscriber-bonus-debate-questions)with bonus questions from Thursday’s mock debate post.
